/**
 * Opening a big schema builds every table with all its columns before anything is drawn: about ninety
 * DOM elements per table, a quarter of a second of work for 130 tables on a fast machine and a second
 * or more on a slow one, with the canvas empty throughout. Tables are therefore mounted "lite" first (a
 * header, no columns), which is enough to place and fit the whole schema, and take their columns back
 * in three batches afterwards, the ones nearest the middle of the view first.
 *
 * Few batches, not many: every batch makes the flow rebuild its lookups for all the nodes and relations,
 * so that cost is paid per batch, however few tables it holds. On 132 tables, batches of 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12
 * had every column back after 694, 754, 897, 1104 and 1825 ms; thirty small ones cost four times what one
 * large one did. Three keeps each blocking step short while paying the per-batch cost three times.
 *
 * A small schema does not need it and never goes lite. A table added later does not either: only the
 * tables present at the first load are ever in the set.
