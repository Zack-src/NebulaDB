 * What `index.html` started before the application's JavaScript was even parsed.

 * A deep link to `/project/:id` needs the session, the project's summary and the live document, and all
 * three are known from the URL alone. The inline script in `index.html` asks for them at once, in
 * parallel with the download of the bundle; the code that would have asked for them later picks the
 * answers up here instead. Each is handed out once, and only while it is fresh: an answer older than a
 * few seconds belongs to a page nobody is looking at any more.
