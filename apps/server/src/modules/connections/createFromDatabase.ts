/**
 * The "New Project from Database" entry point: creates a brand-new project,
 * attaches the given connection to it, and introspects the live schema
 * straight into its (still-empty) canvas — three existing building blocks
 * (`createProjectForUser`, `saveConnection`, `pullConnectionSchema`) chained
 * into one atomic-feeling call so the caller never sees a project that exists
 * but has no schema yet.
 *
 * `pullConnectionSchema` already treats "no existing tables" as the base
 * case for its merge (a fresh project's canvas has none), so it needs no
 * project-creation-specific variant — the empty-project case is just the
 * simplest input it already handles.
 *
 * If introspection fails (bad credentials slipped past `test`, host became
 * unreachable, schema too large, etc.), the just-created project and
 * connection are deleted rather than left behind as a dead, empty project —
 * `deleteProject`'s cascade doesn't touch `project_connections` (see
 * `deleteProjectCascade`, a pre-existing gap unrelated to this feature), so
 * the connection is deleted explicitly first.
