# Changelog

Notable changes to NebulaDB. The project is self-hosted: this file
exists so an operator upgrading an instance can tell, before pulling, whether a
release changes the database, the configuration, or anything they have to do by
hand.

Database migrations run automatically at boot (`apps/server/src/infrastructure/migrations.ts`,
recorded in the `schema_migrations` table) and are one-way — take a backup before
upgrading (`npm run backup -- <dir>`).

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Versioning

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): every workspace `package.json` shares
one version number. Releases are tagged (`vX.Y.Z`) on `main` at points this file
has a dated entry for. Version 1.0.0 is the first release under the NebulaDB name.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed — safer defaults for outbound connections (read before upgrading)

- Webhooks to loopback, private and link-local addresses are **refused by default**. A receiver on your LAN
  needs `NEBULADB_WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (or `NEBULADB_WEBHOOK_BLOCK_PRIVATE=0` to go back to the old behaviour).
- A connection that uses TLS now **verifies the server certificate** unless "verify" was explicitly unchecked.
  A connection saved without that setting and pointing at a self-signed certificate needs its CA, or the box unchecked.
- An SSH tunnel remembers the host key it first connected to and refuses a different one afterwards.
- SQLite connections can only be created by administrators.

### Added — initial data of any size

- A table's initial data is no longer capped at 2 MB / 50 000 rows. Past 2 MB the CSV is sent as a raw
  stream (progress shown), **kept as a file on the server** (`NEBULADB_SEED_DIR`, default `data/seeds`) and
  read as a stream: checked as it arrives (types, lengths, NOT NULL, row width, primary key / UNIQUE,
  foreign keys against the parent seed) and inserted in batches inside one transaction per table.
  Up to `NEBULADB_SEED_FILE_MAX_GB` (default 20) per file; the checks that need to remember keys give up,
  and say so, past `NEBULADB_SEED_MAX_KEYS` values (default 5 000 000).
- Instance administrators can import a file, or a whole folder of `<table>.csv`, from the server's own disk
  with the new `NEBULADB_SEED_IMPORT_DIR` (unset: off). Columns are matched to the table's by name.
- **Database migration 12** adds `table_seeds.storage`, `file_name` and `check_json`. A project bundle does
  not carry the seeds kept as files (they stay in `NEBULADB_SEED_DIR`: back that folder up with the database).

### Changed — NebulaDB's own data moves to PostgreSQL (read before upgrading)

- NebulaDB now stores its users, projects, revisions, connections and everything else in
  **PostgreSQL**, and only there. `NEBULADB_DATABASE_URL` is required; `NEBULADB_DB_PATH` is no
  longer read (the server stops at boot and says what to do). `NEBULADB_DATABASE_POOL_SIZE`
  (default 10) sizes the connection pool. `docker-compose.yml` adds a `postgres` service and needs
  `NEBULADB_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
- **Moving an existing instance:** start the new version on an empty PostgreSQL database, then
  `npm run migrate-from-sqlite -- <path-to-sqlite-file>`. It copies every table in one
  transaction, refuses a target that already holds data and a file older than schema 45, and
  checks the row counts. Keep the SQLite file as a backup. Tried on a copy of a real instance.
- Schema changes are now recorded in `schema_migrations` (PostgreSQL migration 1 is the whole
  former SQLite schema; 2–6 add saved queries, e-mail drift alerts, acknowledgements, mutes and
  deployment reviews; 7 adds `user_identities` for single sign-on; 8 folders and client variants). Timestamps keep their `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` UTC form in the API.
- Concurrency that SQLite's synchronous access used to hide is now handled explicitly: login
  lockout counting, single use of 2FA backup codes, the last administrator, one running backup per
  database, the order of revisions in collaborative editing.
- Tests (server, CLI, browser) run against a throwaway PostgreSQL:
  `docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d nebuladb-test-postgres`.
- SQLite remains a supported **target** engine for the databases a project deploys to.

### Added — project folders and client variants

- **Folders** in the project list: "Nouveau dossier", nested up to 5 levels, a path to go back up, rename and
  delete (what a deleted folder held moves up one level; no project is deleted). A project moves into a folder
  from its card (project administrators); a project created inside a folder lands there. One tree for the
  instance: each person sees the folders leading to a project they can open, the ones they made, and an instance
  administrator sees all. Only whoever made a folder, or an instance administrator, changes it.
- **Client variants**: a project's new **Variantes** tab makes a full copy of it (schema, layout, locks, seeds,
  generator settings) for one client, in the same folder. A variant has no variants of its own.
- When the original changes, its Variantes tab shows how far behind each variant is (changes to receive,
  conflicts, the client's own adaptations). **"Envoyer les changements"** to the chosen variants opens a preview
  per variant: every change ticked to be sent, untick what should not go; a conflict (the client changed the
  same thing) keeps the client's version unless "Prendre l'original" is chosen. What is not sent becomes the
  variant's own and is not offered again. Only the structure travels (tables, columns, indexes, relations,
  enums, table groups) — positions and layout never. A variant can also take its original's changes from its
  own tab, and be detached to become an independent project.
- A variant can be **reset** to its original (its structure becomes the original's again, its layout kept) or
  **copied from another variant** of the same original; it can be renamed and put in the trash from the
  original's Variantes tab ("Actions"). The previous version stays in the History tab. Audited as
  `project.variant.reset`.
- **Switching** between an original and its variants from the project header (the "Original" / "Variante" pill).
- In the project list, a **right click** offers a new folder or project (empty area), the project's actions —
  open, rename, move, new client variant, trash — and the folder's — open, new subfolder, rename, delete. A
  project is **dragged** onto a folder, or onto a step of the folder path, to move it.
- **Comparison** of any two versions (original and client, or two clients): tables only one side has, and the
  columns that differ with each side's definition.
- Audited as `folder.create|update|delete`, `project.folder`, `project.variant.create|push|detach`. Migration 8
  (`project_folders`, `projects.folder_id`, `project_variants`). `GET /api/projects` and `/api/v1/projects` add
  `folderId` and `variantOf`.

### Added — GitHub Action

- `actions/nebuladb`: a composite GitHub Action running one `nebuladb` CLI command (`lint`, `drift-check`,
  `deploy-plan`, `deploy`) from a workflow. The API key reaches the CLI through the environment only, the
  CLI's exit code becomes the step's, and its output goes to the job summary. By default the action builds
  the CLI from its own checkout, so it always matches the instance's version.

### Added — backups to S3 and SFTP

- A database's backups can go to an **S3-compatible bucket** (AWS S3, MinIO, Scaleway, OVH…) or an **SFTP
  server** instead of a folder of the server: Admin → Connexions → Monitoring → Sauvegardes → Emplacement.
  The destination is tried (a file written, read back, deleted) before it is kept. What reaches it is already
  gzipped and encrypted with the backup's own key, so the remote never sees plain data.
- The keys, password or private key are encrypted with the instance secret (`npm run rotate-secret`
  re-encrypts them) and are never returned; leaving them empty keeps the saved ones, but only while the
  bucket and endpoint, or the host, port and user, stay the same. An SFTP destination requires the server's
  host key fingerprint and refuses any other key. S3 and SFTP hosts go through the same outbound check as
  database connections (no cloud metadata addresses, checked again at connect time).
- A backup remembers where it was written, so changing a connection's destination leaves the older backups
  readable. A remote that cannot be reached answers `BACKUP_STORAGE_UNREACHABLE` with its own reason and
  the backup record is kept. Deleting a connection removes its remote files in the background.
- Migration 10 adds `backup_destinations`, `db_connections.backup_destination_id` and `backups.destination_id`.
  `docker-compose.test.yml` gains MinIO and SFTP containers for the destination tests.

### Added — read-only share links

- A project administrator can create a **share link** (project card, eye icon) to the project's diagram, its
  data dictionary or both, for people with no account. Off by default: an instance administrator turns
  the feature on in Administration → Share links, where every link of the instance is listed and can be revoked.
  A link lasts 1 to 365 days (30 by default), at most 50 live links per project.
- Only the SHA-256 of the token is stored; the full address is shown once, at creation. The public page and its
  API never read the viewer's session, send `no-store`, `no-referrer` and `noindex` headers, and keep the token
  out of the logs. The dictionary shown leaves out the owner annotations. Revoked, expired, unknown links and a
  trashed project all answer the same way.
- Migration 9 adds the `share_links` table.

### Added — single sign-on (OpenID Connect)

- Admin → **Connexion unique (SSO)**: one OpenID Connect provider (Keycloak, Entra ID, Google
  Workspace, Authentik, Okta…) — issuer URL, client id and secret (encrypted, never sent back),
  button label, allowed e-mail domains, accounts created on first sign-in (never administrators).
  "Tester le fournisseur" reads the discovery document. The page shows the redirect URI to register
  at the provider: `NEBULADB_PUBLIC_URL` + `/api/auth/sso/callback` when set, otherwise the address
  the console is reached by.
- The login page offers "Se connecter avec …" next to the password. Authorization code flow with
  PKCE, state and nonce; the ID token is checked (signature, issuer, audience, nonce).
- A provider account is tied to a NebulaDB user by the provider's identifier (`sub`), never by
  e-mail after the first sign-in. The first sign-in finds the user with the same address only when
  the provider says it is verified, or when its domain is in the allowed list (for providers that do
  not say, such as Entra ID). A refused sign-in comes back to the login page with the reason.
  Two-factor codes are not asked after SSO: the provider's own MFA applies. Password sign-in stays.
- Audited as `auth.sso.login`, `auth.sso.refused`, `user.sso.create`, `user.sso.link`,
  `instance.sso`. Migration 7 (`user_identities`).

### Added — TLS certificates and SSH tunnels for connections

- A connection's **Sécurité** tab: check the server's certificate against the connection's own
  authority (PEM) or the system ones, and send a client certificate and key when the server asks for
  one — PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQL Server tried; Oracle goes over `tcps` with the authority as wallet
  content, untested. The certificate is checked against the host name typed, even though the socket
  goes to the pinned address. MySQL connections now honour "Activer SSL / TLS" (they ignored it).
- **SSH tunnel**: the database is reached through an SSH server (password, or private key with its
  passphrase); the host and port of the connection are then the ones the SSH server sees. The host
  key fingerprint (`SHA256:…`) is filled in by the first test and enforced once saved. Only for
  connections made of a host and a port, not a connection string.
- The client key and the SSH secrets are encrypted with the rest of the connection and never sent
  back; an empty field keeps the stored one. `/api/v1` connection routes and the OpenAPI document
  carry the new fields (`sslVerify`, `sslCa`, `sslCert`, `sslKey`, `sshTunnel`).

### Added — deployments

- A **`deploy`** project level between `edit` and `administrator`: plan, deploy, roll back, read
  the history, compare databases, check for drift — not manage connections, teams or settings.
- **Review before a "Revue" stage**: the deployment is prepared and frozen, another person who may
  deploy approves or rejects it (never its author), and the approved request is deployed only if
  the plan is unchanged. Approvals expire after 7 days. Notifications, audit, webhook event
  `deployment.review`, `/api/v1` routes.
- **Export of the deployment history** as numbered SQL, Flyway or Liquibase files in a zip.

### Added — SQL and data

- The SQL console is a **CodeMirror editor** with the connection's dialect and completion of tables
  and columns; **saved queries**, private or shared; **row editing** from the explorer (primary key
  required, statements shown before they run, all or nothing); **index suggestions** from the
  statements run, added through the project's schema.

### Added — monitoring

- **E-mail alerts** for drift (per account, when SMTP is configured), **acknowledging** an alert,
  and **muting** a project's alerts for a while with a reason.

### Added — interface and tools

- A global **`Ctrl+K` palette**; the connection form in **tabs**; the server's databases offered when
  choosing a project's database; stage variables as a **key/value table**; ignored tables picked
  from the schema; a notice when a project leaves the trash detached from a connection; multi-line
  dictionary descriptions and a **PDF export** of the dictionary.
- **`nebuladb` command-line client** (`packages/cli`) over `/api/v1`, which now also exposes the
  deployment plan and project bundles.

### Added — a watch imposed from the connection

- Admin → Connexions → a connection → **Imposer la surveillance des modifications hors Nebula**,
  with a frequency. Every project attached to that connection is then watched, at least that
  often, whatever the project chose; its Surveillance card shows where the rule comes from, and
  its administrators can neither switch it off nor change the ignored tables
  (`403 MONITORING_LOCKED`, also on `/api/v1`) — instance administrators still set the ignored
  tables. Unticking gives each project back what it had chosen. Audited as `dbconn.monitoring`.
  `GET …/monitoring` adds `settings.forced`. Migration 44 (`db_connections.monitor_forced`,
  `monitor_interval_minutes`); off for every existing connection.

### Added — a backup location per connection

- Admin → Connexions → Monitoring → Sauvegardes → **Emplacement des sauvegardes**: the folder of the
  server a database's backups are written to — a local folder or a network share mounted on the
  server (NFS, SMB; a `\\server\share` path on Windows). It is created and written to before it is
  kept (`BACKUP_DESTINATION_UNUSABLE` with the system's reason otherwise). Empty: the instance's
  own folder, `NEBULADB_DATABASE_BACKUP_DIR`, as before. A backup remembers where it was written,
  so the ones already taken stay readable, downloadable and restorable after a change.
  `PUT /api/admin/connections/:id/backup-destination`, audited as `backup.destination`.
  Migration 45 (`db_connections.backup_dir`, `backups.dir`). **The account the server runs as
  needs write access to that folder**, and the files there are still encrypted: they are read
  back through Nebula, with `NEBULADB_SECRET`.

### Fixed — a project in the trash kept its database

- A database used by a project in the trash could not be given to another project
  (`CONNECTION_DATABASE_TAKEN`) until the trash was emptied — and the admin form did not show
  the project holding it. A trashed project no longer holds its database, and is listed in the
  connection's form with a "Corbeille" badge. Restored after its database was given away, it
  comes back detached from that connection.

### Removed

- Project templates (blog, e-commerce, SaaS, authentication) are gone from the application; the
  `template` field is no longer documented on `POST /api/v1/projects` and is ignored if sent.

### Added — BigQuery as a deployment target

- A connection can be a **BigQuery dataset** (engine `bigquery`): the Google Cloud
  project, the dataset, and optionally the JSON key of a service account — without a
  key, the credentials of the machine NebulaDB runs on are used (Application Default
  Credentials). The dataset must exist. New dependency: `@google-cloud/bigquery`.
- Planning, deploying (schema and seeds), rolling back and reading a schema back work
  as on the other engines. The SQL is GoogleSQL: `STRING`, `INT64`, `BOOL`, `NUMERIC`,
  `DATETIME`…, no transaction around DDL, primary and foreign keys declared
  `NOT ENFORCED`. BigQuery has no unique constraint, no index and no auto-increment,
  and refuses a foreign key from a table to itself: those parts of a schema are left
  out there (neither deployed nor shown as still to do), and nothing in the dataset
  checks a key — the seeds are validated before they go in, as everywhere.
- The admin console works on a BigQuery connection: tables with their sizes, columns
  and declared keys, rows, the SQL console in read and write mode, health, backups.
  Accounts, sessions and locks are not shown — access to a dataset is Google Cloud IAM's
  — and a connection cannot ask each user for a personal account.
- Comparing two databases of different engines no longer reports every table: types
  are compared without their engine's spelling (`varchar(255)` and `STRING(255)`,
  `int` and `INT64`), and a size only one of the two catalogues gives is ignored.

### Fixed — a schema written for one engine, deployed on another

- `varchar(max)` / `nvarchar(max)` / `varbinary(max)` are translated outside SQL Server
  (`text`, `longtext`, `clob`, `bytea`…); they used to be sent as written and refused.
- `bit` is read as a boolean: kept where the word exists, `number(1)` on Oracle.
- A "current date and time" default is written the way the target spells it
  (`GETDATE()` on SQL Server, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` elsewhere), and the two are no
  longer reported as a difference by the live diff.

### Fixed — deployments and seeds on SQL Server

- A table created by a deployment now gets its auto-increment columns: `increment`
  becomes `IDENTITY(1,1)` (SQL Server), `GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` (PostgreSQL,
  Oracle) or `AUTO_INCREMENT` (MySQL), as the SQL export already wrote. Until now the
  setting was dropped and the column was a plain integer. Tables that already exist are
  left as they are: no engine turns a column into an identity with an `ALTER`.
- Seeds and restored backups that give the value of an identity column are inserted on
  SQL Server (`IDENTITY_INSERT`), instead of failing on "Cannot insert explicit value for
  identity column".
- A type written `decimal(18.6)` is deployed as `decimal(18,6)`. The repair existed but
  never matched.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-10-06

### Changed — NebulaDB and the new workspace

- Renamed AthanorDB to **NebulaDB**, including packages, configuration, interface,
  documentation and the GitHub repository. Existing settings, credentials,
  sessions, plugins and backups remain usable; see
  [the migration guide](docs/renommage-nebuladb.md).
- Redesigned the workspace, navigation, project views and database access.
- Simplified project deployments, unified avatars and added SQL history controls.
- Consolidated administrator users and invitations and added management of teams,
  individual project roles and per-project databases.

### Added — access managed from the administrator's side

- Admin → Utilisateurs → **Équipes et projets**: a person's teams (add, remove) and the projects
  they own or were given a level on, in one dialog. A level can now be given to **one person**
  on a project, next to the ones their teams give (`PUT` / `DELETE /api/projects/:id/members/:userId`,
  migration 43, `project_members`) — how someone becomes administrator of a project they did not
  create. A first person assigned makes an open project private, as a first team does.
- Admin → Équipes → a team: the **projects** it opens and at what level, edited there.
- Admin → Connexions → a connection: each attached project can have a **database of its own**
  on that server (`project_connection_links.database_name`), created on the server when asked
  (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server). Every project route on that connection uses it.

### Changed

- Two projects can no longer be attached to the **same database** of one connection
  (`CONNECTION_DATABASE_TAKEN`): at most one uses the connection's own database. Links that
  already share one keep working and are refused the next time the connection's projects are
  saved, until each has a database.
- A member can no longer create, edit or test a project connection pointing at a server an
  instance administrator already connected (`CONNECTION_TARGET_MANAGED`): the administrator
  attaches theirs to the project instead.

### Added — a "Santé" tab on each connection

- Admin → Connexions → Ouvrir → **Santé**: a fresh probe on opening (status, latency, version), a
  latency series from the last probes (migration 41, `db_health_samples`, a week kept — every
  probe adds a point, the background check included), databases and sizes, session counts
  (active / idle, longest), and the sessions **waiting on a lock** with the one holding it
  (`DatabaseAdminDriver.listBlocking`: `pg_blocking_pids`, `sys.innodb_lock_waits`,
  `sys.dm_exec_requests`, `v$session`). A part the engine or the account cannot give reads "Non
  disponible", never zero. `GET /api/admin/connections/:id/health-board`.

### Added — traffic measured by the database server

- Migration 40: `db_counter_samples`. Each activity sample (manual or every 5 min) also reads the
  server's cumulative counters (`DatabaseAdminDriver.readCounters`): PostgreSQL transactions and
  rows read (no byte totals, and transactions are not queries — labelled so), MySQL `Questions`
  and `Bytes_sent` / `Bytes_received`, SQL Server batch requests, Oracle user calls and SQL*Net
  bytes. A field the engine or the account lacks is empty, never estimated.
- Journal → Côté base → **Trafic mesuré par le serveur**: differences between reads, per hour (up to
  3 days) or per day; a restart (negative difference) is skipped. `GET …/activity/traffic?days=`.

### Added — database-side sessions (level 1 of the database-side logs)

- Migration 39: `db_activity` (per connection, session fingerprint and UTC day: account, database,
  client, state, statement shape with literals masked, times seen, longest) and `db_activity_watch`.
- Admin → Connexions → Ouvrir → Journal → **Côté base**: "Relever maintenant" reads the server's
  sessions (`pg_stat_activity`, `PROCESSLIST`, DMVs, `V$SESSION`, through the console's session
  list), and "Relever toutes les 5 min" does it on a schedule per connection. Accounts Nebula signs
  in with (by name) are flagged and can be left out. A snapshot: a statement shorter than the
  interval can be missed. Nebula configures no audit on the server.
- `GET /api/admin/connections/:id/activity`, `POST …/activity/sample`, `PUT …/activity/watch`;
  audit `dbconn.activity.sample` / `dbconn.activity.watch`.
- `NEBULADB_DB_ACTIVITY_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 14, `0` keeps all).

### Added — create the database account with the invitation

- An invitation entry on a personal-account, writable connection can carry `createAccount: true`
  (with the proposed account name). When the invitation is accepted, the connection's service
  account creates that account with a random password, which is kept as the person's own
  personal account: nobody sees it. The new account has no privilege yet. A failure is audited
  (`dbuser.create_failed`) and changes nothing else. Refused outside invitations.

### Added — "Mes comptes SQL" in Settings

- `GET /api/me/sql-accounts` lists every personal-account connection the caller may use (instance
  administrator, project administrator of a linked project, or granted access), with their account
  name, its date and the name an administrator proposed. Never a password; an API key sees none.
- Settings → Profil has a "Mes comptes SQL" block: one row per connection, add or change the
  account in the same dialog as the workspace button. Hidden when there is none.

### Added — a library of lint presets, a default for every project, custom rules

**Read before upgrading:** migration **38** adds the table `lint_presets` and the columns
`lint_settings.preset_id` and `lint_settings.use_own`. Every project that already had lint
settings keeps exactly those (they become its own version, `use_own = 1`); the library
starts empty and no preset is the default, so nothing changes for anyone until an instance
administrator creates one. `GET /api/projects/:id/lint` now answers `{ settings, source,
presets }` (it answered `{ settings }`); `PUT` accepts `{ settings }` or `{ presetId }` and
still accepts the settings as the whole body. `/api/v1/projects/:id/lint` adds `source`.

Instance administrators manage a library of lint presets (Admin → Lint), mark one as the
default for every project that chose none, and apply one to projects. A project follows a
preset, the default, or keeps a version of its own (editing a rule makes it). Settings can
carry up to 20 **custom rules**: declarative checks of table or column names against a
case-insensitive regular expression (200 characters at most), optionally limited to some
tables, with a level and a message. They are never run as code; they can block a
deployment like any rule at level `error`, and be excepted per table
(`lint-ignore: custom:<id>` in a note).

### Added — accounts watch, a database's journal, SQL console figures

**Read before upgrading:** migration **37** adds `monitor_settings.watch_accounts` (off for
every project), `drift_events.details_json`, and the tables `account_baselines` and
`query_stats`. Nothing is read from any database until an instance administrator turns the
accounts watch on for a project. New setting `NEBULADB_QUERY_STATS_RETENTION_DAYS` (30 by
default, `0` keeps everything): how long the SQL console's per-statement figures are kept —
they hold the last author of each statement shape, so mention it in your privacy policy if
you publish one (`docs/legal/confidentialite.md` is updated).

- **Accounts and privileges changed outside Nebula** (Déploiements → Surveillance, instance
  administrators). An option of the watch reads, on each linked database that has accounts,
  the accounts and roles, their locks, role memberships and privileges (the administration
  drivers' listing calls, the connection's stored account, under the connection budget), as a
  canonical fingerprint compared with a reference. A change made through the console's
  _Utilisateurs et permissions_ tab moves the reference (the accounts are read just before and
  just after it); any other difference is an alert: listed in the card, written to the
  database's journal (`monitoring.accounts`), told to the project's followers who administer it
  (without the accounts' names) and sent to its webhooks as `drift.detected` with
  `kind: "accounts"` — see `docs/webhooks.md`. **Accepter l'état actuel** takes what was read as
  the new reference. Names and privileges only: no password or hash is ever read. Not offered
  on SQLite. Checked against real PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQL Server servers.
- **A database's journal** (Admin → Connexions → Ouvrir → **Journal**): the audit log filtered
  on that database — console opened (`dbconn.open`), connection tested (`dbconn.test`), SQL
  statements, deployments and rollbacks, account changes, what the watch found (new type
  _Surveillance_, also in Admin → Activité: `monitoring.drift`, `monitoring.unreachable`,
  `monitoring.accounts`) — with period, type and author filters, paging and CSV / JSON export.
- **Requêtes**, in the same tab: the statements run through the SQL console, grouped by shape
  (every literal replaced by `?`, no value and no result kept): runs, failures, average / max /
  total duration, average rows, last run and author; sorted by frequency, slowness or total
  time. Durations are measured by Nebula around the call and labelled as such.

### Fixed

- PostgreSQL, Users & permissions: a table nobody had been granted anything on showed no
  privileges for its owner; they appeared the first time anyone was granted something on it.
  The owner's default privileges are now read, as they already were for schemas and databases.

### Added — database access for members (explorer and SQL, granted per connection)

**Read before upgrading:** migration **36** adds `db_access_grants`, `db_account_hints` and
`invitations.grants_json`. Nothing is granted on upgrade: the console stays the instance
administrators' until one of them grants a connection. The explorer and SQL calls of the web
app moved to `/api/connections/:id/…` (the `/api/admin/connections/:id/…` routes still exist,
unchanged, for instance administrators) — a reverse proxy that only lets `/api/admin` through to
administrators' networks must let these through as well.

- **An instance administrator grants a user or a team `read` or `write` on a connection**
  (Admin → Utilisateurs, icon on the person's line; Admin → Équipes, a team; Admin →
  Invitations). `read`: the explorer and read-only SQL (one reading statement, READ ONLY
  transaction, 1 000 rows, 30 s). `write`: also `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` / `MERGE`, one at a
  time, each confirmed — the server requires `confirmWrite`. **Never structure**, whatever the
  connection's structure policy, and never drops, database accounts, sessions or backups.
  Being in a project gives no access to its database; the grant is checked on every request, so
  a revocation (or leaving the team) applies at once. Every query a member runs, refused ones
  included, is audited (`dbaccess.query`). Grants work from a browser session only, not with an
  API key. On a personal-accounts connection the member runs as their own account and is refused
  without one.
- **Données & SQL and the SQL drawer (`Ctrl+J`)** are offered to a member on the project's
  connections they were granted; the console shows their level and hides what they cannot do.
- **Invitations carry teams and database access**, with the database account name proposed on
  each connection: all applied the moment the invitation is accepted. The same name can be set
  for an existing user ("associate a database account"): it pre-fills **Mon compte SQL**; the
  password is always typed by the person, never stored in clear nor sent back.
- **The console protects the connection's own account**: dropping, locking or changing the
  password of the account the connection signs in with (stored, in its connection string, or —
  in personal mode — one's own) is refused, already on the preview
  (`DB_ADMIN_CONNECTION_ACCOUNT_PROTECTED`).

### Added (canvas) — copy / paste of enums, zones and notes

- **`Ctrl/Cmd+C` / `Ctrl/Cmd+V` now also copy the selected enums, zones and sticky
  notes**, not only tables, with the same rules: across projects, `_copy` names for
  tables and enums (a zone or note keeps its label), a relation to a table that was not
  copied is left out, a copy of a locked table is a new, unlocked table. Pasted into
  the DBML editor, the clipboard gives the tables and enums as DBML (a zone or note as a
  `//` comment line). The status message now counts elements ("4 éléments copiés").

### Fixed (SQL export, schema diff)

- **SQL export no longer writes `UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY`** for a column flagged both `pk`
  and `unique` (also for a primary key declared by a composite index): SQL Server
  rejected it as a redundant constraint. `unique` is dropped from primary-key columns
  for the export only; the project and its DBML are untouched.
- **Less noise when comparing with a real database** (deployment, monitoring):
  `decimal` and `numeric` are one type when the live column reports no precision;
  primary-key columns count as NOT NULL (composite keys included); a composite
  primary key no longer shows up as an "added" index. A migration repairs the typo
  `decimal(18.6)` to `decimal(18,6)` instead of emitting invalid SQL.

### Added (comments) — mentions and notifications

- **`@` in a comment offers the people who can see the project** — and only
  them — filtered as you type, with arrows / Enter / Esc. A mention is stored
  in the comment as `@[Name](account-id)` and shown highlighted. Comments now
  also carry their author's account id (`authorId`); older comments have none
  and do not count as "someone who wrote in the thread".
- **Mentioned, or replied to, you are told in the notification centre**, and
  at once when the project is open — even if you do not follow it (a mention
  is an address, not a subscription). Never for your own comment, never when you
  can no longer see the project. The notification holds names only (author,
  table, column), never the comment's text.
- New routes: `GET /api/projects/:id/mentionable?q=` and
  `POST /api/projects/:id/comment-notices` (both need `edit`). **No database
  migration.**

### Fixed (database connections) — check connections that were switched from a URI

- **A connection saved with a connection string and later switched to host and
  port kept the string**, and went on connecting to the old address (the
  drivers prefer the string). Saving such a connection now drops it; the
  reverse — a new string — drops the host fields. **A connection edited that
  way before this fix still holds both:** open it and save it once.

### Added (result grid)

- **SQL results and the explorer's rows are shown in a new grid**: click a
  header to sort (numbers by value, NULL last), drag a header's edge — or use
  the arrow keys on it — to resize a column, and a 10 000-row result scrolls
  without slowing the page. Columns take the width of their content instead of
  stretching; widths are not remembered.

### Added (public API)

- **Personal database accounts**: `GET` / `PUT` /
  `DELETE /api/v1/connections/:id/credentials` — the account of the key's
  owner on a connection that asks each user for theirs, so a CI job can give
  it. Scope `connections:manage`; a key restricted to one project only on that
  project's connections.
- **A CI example** in `docs/public-api.md`: lint, drift check, then deploy.

### Changed

- Fifteen more screens use the application's own lists, checkboxes and radio
  buttons (deployment dialog, project teams, API keys, import, login…). In the
  deployment dialog the risk strategies are plain radio buttons.

### Added (personal database accounts)

- **A connection can ask each user for their own database account** instead of
  sharing one: Admin → Connexions → a connection → "Compte utilisé pour se
  connecter" → **Le compte de chacun**. Whatever a person then does on that
  database through Nebula — deployment plan, deployment, rollback, pull,
  comparison, drift check, the console (explorer, SQL, users, sessions),
  backups and restores they start, reading a table as initial data — is done
  as their own account: the database's logs say who did what, and its
  permissions decide what each person may do.
- **"Mon compte SQL"**, next to the database in a project and in the admin
  list: each user gives their account there. It is tried on the database
  before being kept; the password is encrypted like a connection's and never
  shown again. Without an account, a person is refused
  (`409 PERSONAL_CREDENTIALS_REQUIRED`) — never connected with the shared
  account instead.
- **The account stored on the connection becomes its service account**: used
  only by work nobody is behind — the watch, scheduled backups, the
  availability check. It can be a read-only account.
- Existing connections are unchanged (one shared account). Not available for a
  SQLite file or a connection given as a connection string. Only an instance
  administrator changes the mode; the change, and each account given or
  removed, are in the activity journal (`dbconn.auth_mode`,
  `dbconn.credentials.set` / `.remove`).
- Routes: `GET` / `PUT` / `DELETE /api/connections/:id/credentials` (one's
  own), `GET /api/admin/connections/:id/credentials` (who has given one).
  Migration 35 (`db_connections.auth_mode`, `db_connection_credentials`);
  `npm run rotate-secret` re-encrypts the new table too. The personal-data
  export lists the accounts given (names); deleting an Nebula account or a
  connection deletes them.
- An API key acts as its owner, so `/api/v1` uses the owner's database account
  on such a connection.

### Added (public API)

- **Database backups**: `GET` / `POST /api/v1/connections/:id/backups` (list,
  start — answers `202`), `GET /api/v1/backups/:id` (poll until done),
  `POST …/cancel`, `DELETE`, `GET …/download` (the decrypted `.jsonl.gz`).
  Instance administrators, scope `connections:manage`; a key restricted to one
  project is refused. Restoring stays in the application.

### Changed

- **Notifications arrive at once** while the project they concern is open,
  instead of at the next minute. Elsewhere the bell still refreshes every
  minute.
- The webhooks dialog, the connection form and the database users panel use the
  application's own lists, checkboxes and switches instead of the browser's.

### Fixed

- **"Copier" in the deployment dialog copied the plan's first draft**, not the
  SQL shown — which follows the answers given to the risks. It copies what is
  shown.

### Added (webhooks)

- **Regenerate a webhook's signing secret** without deleting the webhook: the
  key button in the Webhooks dialog, or
  `POST …/webhooks/:hookId/rotate-secret`. Its address, events and delivery
  log stay; the new secret is shown once. **The old secret stops signing at
  once** — also for a delivery still waiting to be retried.
- **Webhooks in the public API**: `GET` / `POST /api/v1/projects/:id/webhooks`,
  `PATCH` / `DELETE …/:hookId`, `POST …/:hookId/rotate-secret`,
  `POST …/:hookId/test`, `GET …/:hookId/deliveries` — project administrators,
  behind `projects:read` (list, deliveries) or `projects:write`.

### Changed

- A write-mode SQL run, and importing a database's schema from the connection
  form, are confirmed in the application's own dialog instead of the browser's.

### Fixed

- The deployment dialog showed the server's English message when the plan
  itself was refused (unreachable database, missing personal account); it now
  goes through the translated messages, like a refused deployment.

### Added (small things)

- **Deployment plan**: a table's initial data with warnings says so, next to
  its row count.

### Added (schema quality) — one rule may block a deployment after upgrading

- **Three linter rules.** `personal-data-class`: a column classified personal
  or sensitive in the dictionary, in a table that is not (warning in Standard,
  error in Strict, off in Souple). `column-description`: columns without a
  description, one finding per table — `id` keys and `created_at` /
  `updated_at` are not asked for one (info in Strict, off elsewhere).
  `fk-on-delete`: a foreign key that does not say what deleting the referenced
  row does (info in Strict, off elsewhere). **A project on the Strict profile
  that refuses deployments on errors is now refused while a personal column
  sits in an unclassified table**: classify the table, except it, or lower the
  rule.
- **The deployment dialog names the lint errors that block it** (table and
  finding, the first 20) and has a button to the Problèmes tab; the plan's
  `blockers` carries them as `lintFindings`.
- **Enums in the data dictionary**: listed after the tables with what each
  value means (its note) and the columns that use it — in the Dictionnaire
  tab, the Markdown and HTML exports and the API's JSON (`enums`). Not in the
  CSV export.

### Added (public API)

- `GET` / `PUT /api/v1/projects/:id/monitoring` and
  `POST /api/v1/projects/:id/monitoring/check`: the watch over a project's
  databases — its settings, what it found, and a check on demand a CI job can
  stop on (`result.changes > 0`).

### Added (small things)

- **MCD view**: a locked table keeps its padlock (and dashed border) there,
  with who locked it and why.
- **Pipeline card**: follows the schema by itself — a change made by a
  colleague or an import no longer needs "Actualiser".
- **Initial data**: a CSV column mapped to a table column that has since been
  deleted is reported as a warning in the seed dialog (and counted among the
  seed's warnings in the deployment plan's answer) instead of being left out
  silently.
- **DBML editor**: the status bar uses the application's tooltips, and its
  font-size buttons have a name for screen readers.

### Added (notifications)

- **Follow a project.** The eye in a project's header lets each account choose
  what it wants to be told about: deployments and rollbacks, locks placed or
  lifted, initial data changed, a database changed outside Nebula. Nobody
  follows anything until they choose to.
- **A notification centre** in the project header and on the dashboard, with
  the unread count; opening a notification marks it read and goes to its
  project. In-app only for now — no e-mail.
- Nobody is notified of what they did themselves, nor of what they could not
  see in the app (a deployment only reaches project administrators).
- Migration 34 (`subscriptions`, `notifications`). The personal-data export now
  lists what the account follows; deleting an account or a project deletes its
  subscriptions and notifications.

### Added (public API)

- `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/pipeline` — where the current schema has been
  deployed along the stages — and `POST /api/v1/projects/:id/connections/compare`
  — two of the project's databases against each other. Both read-only, for
  project administrators.

### Added (small things)

- **Activity**: from an entry's detail, "Voir toute son activité" narrows the
  journal — and its exports — to what that person did.
- **Backups**: "Choisir les tables…" backs up only the ticked tables, with a
  note saying why.

### Added (guided tour)

- **A guided tour of the editor** the first time a browser opens a project:
  five short steps — diagram, DBML panel, toolbar, shortcuts, tabs — each
  outlining what it describes, without blocking the editor. Replay it with the
  ⓘ button of the project header.

### Changed (pipeline) — read before upgrading

- **A protected stage no longer takes a schema the stage before it does not
  have.** When a project has databases on several stages, deploying to a stage
  whose protection is "Revue" or "Protégé" — the production stage always is —
  is refused (`409 PIPELINE_STAGE_SKIPPED`) until the nearest earlier stage of
  that project has received the same schema. **After upgrading, every stage
  reads "en retard" until it is deployed to once**, because past deployments
  did not record which schema they deployed: deploy to the earlier stage
  first, or set its successor's protection to "Libre". A project with a single
  database, and a database on no stage, are unaffected.
- **Skipping a stage** is for instance administrators, needs a reason, and is
  audited (`connection.deploy.stage_skipped`): in the deployment dialog once
  the refusal is shown, or `{ skipStageOrder: true, skipReason }` on the API.
- **A "Pipeline" card** on the Déploiements tab shows the project's databases
  along the stages: level, behind, failed or never deployed, and which stage
  one is waiting for.
- The deployment dialog now shows a refused deployment in the interface's
  language instead of the server's English message, and its first step says
  up front what would refuse the deployment: open lint errors (when the
  project blocks on them) and a stage that has to come first.
- Migration 33 (`deployment_history.schema_hash`).

### Fixed (DBML with several schemas)

- **Importing DBML whose tables are in more than one schema lost tables.** Only
  the first schema of the file was read, so `Table sales.orders` next to
  `Table settings` kept one of the two — on import and on every sync of the
  DBML editor. Every schema is read now.
- **A relation between tables of a named schema made the DBML unreadable**: it
  was written without the schema (`Ref: orders.x > people.id`), which the
  parser refuses. Relations are written with their schema, quoted when needed.

### Added (per-environment variables)

- **`{{variables}}` in table names and schemas**, resolved per stage: write
  `Table "{{table_prefix}}orders"` once, give `table_prefix` a value on each
  stage (Admin → Environnements, `name=value, …`), and each database gets its
  own name. Used by the deployment plan, the deployment (DDL and seeds), the
  drift check and the pull. A deployment to a stage that does not define a
  variable the schema uses is refused before anything runs
  (`409 VARIABLES_UNRESOLVED`).
- Migration 32 (`environments.variables_json`). Nothing changes for a schema
  without placeholders.

### Added (compare environments)

- **"Comparer deux environnements"** on a project's Déploiements tab, when it
  has at least two databases: both are read and set side by side — tables
  only one of them has, and for a table that differs, the columns only on one
  side and each column's type, nullability and default on both. A table that
  exists in a database but not in the schema is marked "Hors schéma". Project
  administrators; structure only, no data.

### Added (data dictionary)

- **A "Dictionnaire" tab in every project.** Each table and column gets a
  description, an owner, a classification (public, internal, personal,
  sensitive) and tags, with a completeness bar, a search and two filters (to
  document, personal data). Exports: Markdown, CSV, a self-contained HTML page.
- **Stored in the schema's notes**, as text after the description —
  `[owner: …] [class: …] [tags: …]` — so it follows history, DBML export and
  import. Existing notes are untouched and read as descriptions.
- `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/dictionary` (`?format=markdown|csv|html`).
- The linter's "table described" rule no longer counts a note made only of
  annotations as a description.

### Added (table locks)

- **"Verrous du projet".** As soon as a table is locked, a padlock with the
  count appears in the workspace bar and opens the list of every lock: level,
  who, when, why. Everyone who sees the project can read it and jump to the
  table; whoever may manage a lock changes or lifts it from there.
- **Relations carried by a locked table** can no longer be changed, deleted or
  drawn on the canvas by those the lock binds (their colour and routing still
  can) — instead of being accepted and then put back by the server.
- **A locked table's block is read-only in the DBML editor** for those the
  lock binds: it is tinted, and typing in it is refused with a message, instead
  of being accepted and then failing to synchronise.

### Added (public API)

- **Table locks under `/api/v1`**: `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/locks`, and `PUT` /
  `DELETE /api/v1/projects/:id/locks/:table` to lock a table or lift its lock —
  the table named by its id or by its name. Same rules as in the app (project
  administrators for `project` locks, instance administrators for `instance`
  ones), behind the `projects:read` / `projects:write` scopes.

### Added (initial data from a database)

- **A table's current rows can become its initial data.** In a project's
  Données & SQL tab, a table's new "Données initiales" button — and "Reprendre
  les lignes de la base" in the seed dialog — read the rows the table holds in
  the current database and show them in the seed dialog, checked like a CSV
  file. Nothing is saved until "Enregistrer". Instance administrators only
  (it reads every row, like the console); audited as `seed.read_database`.
  Columns the schema and the database do not share, and binary columns, are
  left out and named; a table larger than a seed may be (50 000 rows, 2 MB)
  gives its first rows, and says so.

### Added (schema linter)

- **A "Problèmes" tab in every project.** The schema is checked against
  conventions as it is edited: primary key present, foreign keys indexed,
  snake_case names, `varchar` with a length, `created_at` / `updated_at`, no
  float for an amount, tables described — plus two lists of your own
  (forbidden types, columns every table must have). Findings are listed table
  by table, open their table in the schema, are underlined in the DBML editor,
  and the errors and warnings show on the table in the diagram. Two of them
  have a one-click fix (add an `id` key, create the foreign-key index).
- **Rules per project.** Project administrators pick a profile (Souple,
  Standard, Strict) or set each rule's level, and except a table from a rule;
  a table can also except itself with `lint-ignore: rule-id` in its note.
  Nothing changes for an existing project until someone does: the default is
  the Standard profile, which blocks nothing.
- **Optionally, an error stops a deployment** ("Refuser un déploiement tant
  qu'une erreur est ouverte", off by default). Checked on the server, for the
  app and `/api/v1` alike: `409 LINT_BLOCKS_DEPLOYMENT` with the findings.
- `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/lint` (scope `projects:read`) returns the same
  findings — a CI step can fail on `summary.error > 0`.
- Migration 31 (`lint_settings`). The "no primary key" warning the diagram
  already showed is now the linter's `pk-required` rule and follows the
  project's profile.

### Added (database backups) — read before upgrading

- **Backups of the connected databases.** In the database console (Admin →
  Connexions → Ouvrir, or a project's Données & SQL tab), a new **Sauvegardes**
  tab: back up now, follow the running one, download, pin, delete, restore.
  A backup is _logical_ — structure and rows read through the driver — and
  stored as one compressed, AES-256 encrypted file with a checksum. Instance
  administrators only.
- **Restore.** The chosen tables are emptied and refilled from a backup, into
  the same database or another one of the same engine, after the database's
  name is retyped. The target's current rows are backed up first. Data only:
  the tables must already exist. Not one transaction across tables — see the
  user guide.
- **A production deployment now backs the database up first.** On the stage
  flagged as production, a deployment that changes something takes a backup
  before running; if the backup does not complete (database larger than the
  limit, unreadable table), **the deployment is refused**. Untick "Sauvegarder
  la base avant de déployer" in the deployment dialog, or send
  `backupBefore: false` to `/api/v1/…/deploy`, to deploy without one. Other
  stages are unchanged (the box is there, unticked).
- **Scheduled backups.** In the Sauvegardes tab, "Sauvegarder automatiquement":
  every day, every week (on a weekday) or every month (on a day from 1 to 28),
  at an hour of the **server's clock**, keeping the last N. Off by default.
  Scheduled backups are kept by that count, not by
  `NEBULADB_DATABASE_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`. A server that was down at the
  hour runs the missed backup once when it is back.
- **Configuration:** `NEBULADB_DATABASE_BACKUP_DIR` (default: a
  `database-backups` folder next to the app database — make sure that volume
  has the room), `NEBULADB_DATABASE_BACKUP_MAX_MB` (512),
  `NEBULADB_DATABASE_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` (30, `0` keeps everything; pinned
  backups are never removed). These are separate from `NEBULADB_BACKUP_*`,
  which still concern NebulaDB's own data.
- **Secret rotation** (`npm run rotate-secret`) now also covers the backups'
  keys. Losing `NEBULADB_SECRET` makes the stored backups unreadable, like
  the stored connections.
- Migrations 29 (`backups`, `deployment_history.backup_id`) and 30
  (`backup_schedules`). Deleting a
  connection deletes its backups.
- Verified on SQLite end to end. On PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server and Oracle
  the code path is written but has not been run against a live server yet:
  try a backup and a restore on a copy before relying on it.

### Changed (project workspace)

- **A project now opens on a workspace with tabs**: Schéma (the editor),
  Données & SQL (the database console, for instance administrators),
  Déploiements (history, rollback, deploy — for project administrators) and
  Historique. Each tab has its own address (`/project/<id>/data`,
  `/deployments`, `/history`). The revision history is a page instead of a
  dialog, and the toolbar's "Historique" button is replaced by the tab.
- **SQL under the diagram.** On the Schéma tab, instance administrators can
  open a SQL panel below the canvas (button in the tab bar, or `Ctrl+J`) on the
  project's current database; a table's "Voir les données" button shows its
  first rows there. Same rules as the console: read-only unless switched,
  audited, structure sent to the schema.
- **Reverse proxies:** nothing to change if `/` is proxied as a whole. A proxy
  that listed the application's paths one by one needs `/project/*/*` as well.
  No database or configuration change.

### Added (watch for outside changes)

- **A project can watch its databases.** Déploiements → "Surveiller les
  modifications hors Nebula": on, how often (5 minutes to daily), tables to
  ignore, "Vérifier maintenant". Each database that was deployed to or pulled
  from is read again and compared with the state that left it; a difference
  nothing in Nebula explains is recorded once, turns on the editor's drift
  banner, and is sent to the project's webhooks (new event `drift.detected`).
  A deployment that failed half-way is named as the likely cause. A database
  that cannot be read is reported "injoignable", never as a change. A
  deployment or a pull settles what was found; "Ignorer" waves it off for good.
  Off by default; project administrators turn it on. API:
  `GET/PUT /api/projects/:id/monitoring`, `POST …/monitoring/check`.
- **Fixed:** dates read from the server (deployment history, error log…) were
  shown as local time while they are UTC — hours off outside UTC.
- **Database change:** migration 28 adds `monitor_settings` and
  `drift_events`. Automatic, one-way.

### Changed (admin activity)

- **Admin → Activité replaces the audit tab.** One list of what was done
  through Nebula — structure, data, deployments, accounts, sessions,
  projects, configuration — filtered by period, type, project, database and
  text, paged ("Entrées plus anciennes"), each entry opening on its detail
  (actor, full detail, project with a link, database, IP, request id), and
  exportable as CSV or JSON with the same filters. Read-only, admin-only, as
  before. API: `GET /api/admin/activity`, `GET /api/admin/activity/export`.
- Audit entries now record the project and the database they concern and the
  request that produced them; request ids are UUIDs (they were a per-process
  counter, `req-1`…), also in the server log.
- **Database change:** migration 27 adds `project_id`, `connection_id` and
  `correlation_id` to `audit_log` and fills the first two for older entries
  whose target was a project or a connection. Automatic, one-way.

### Added (test data)

- **Generate test rows for a table** — the "Générer" tab of its initial data:
  a generator per column, suggested from its name and type (e-mail, phone,
  first name, city, dates, numbers, weighted choices, UUID, sequence, fixed
  value…), a volume (up to 10 000), a seed that makes the run repeatable, a
  locale (French, English). Built from the structure only — no real row is
  read; a foreign key draws from the parent table's initial data. NOT NULL,
  unique columns and declared lengths are respected. The rows can be exported
  as CSV or used as the table's initial data, where they are checked like any
  file. The settings are kept per table.
- An extension point (`DataGeneratorProvider`) lets another generator — an AI
  service, later — plug in; only the built-in one exists, and nothing enables
  another. API: `/api/projects/:id/generators/:tableId[/run]`.
- **Database change:** migration 26 adds the `generator_configs` table.

### Added (initial data)

- **Tables can bring rows: CSV seeds.** On the canvas, a table's "Données
  initiales" button takes a CSV file (2 MB / 50 000 rows at most, separator
  detected, UTF-8 or Windows-1252), matches its columns to the table's by name,
  and previews it checked against the table: types, NOT NULL, lengths,
  duplicates under a key, required columns left out, formula-looking text. A
  table with a seed shows it in its header.
- **Deployments insert them after the DDL**, parents before the tables that
  point at them, one transaction per table, with bound parameters. By default
  only into an empty table, so a second deployment adds nothing ("Toujours
  ajouter" changes that). The plan lists `customers : +248 lignes` and can
  leave the seeds out; a seed with errors, a foreign key with no parent in the
  parent's seed, or seeded tables depending on each other in a cycle stop the
  deployment before anything runs (`409 SEEDS_NOT_DEPLOYABLE`). What each
  table got is kept in the deployment history. API: `skipSeeds` on deploy.
- A `full` table lock now also freezes the table's seed.
- **Database change:** migration 25 adds the `table_seeds` table and
  `deployment_history.seed_report`. Automatic, one-way.

### Changed (deployment safety) — read before upgrading

- **"Annuler / Gérer manuellement" now cancels.** The option was offered on
  every risk of a deployment plan and then ignored: the change ran anyway — a
  dropped column with data was dropped. A deployment with a risk set to it is
  now refused (`409 DEPLOYMENT_BLOCKED_BY_RISK`).
- **The plan measures more, and reads no rows.** Besides dropped tables and
  columns, type changes and NOT NULL over NULLs, it now checks a new NOT NULL
  column without a default on a table with rows, a text limit below the
  longest value, a new unique constraint over duplicates and a new foreign key
  over orphans — on every engine (SQL Server and Oracle only checked dropped
  tables). Only aggregates are run (counts, maximum lengths), each bounded in
  time; the plan no longer shows sample values from the database. A check that
  could not run is shown as "non mesuré", never as safe.
- **The server measures again when deploying**, whatever the client sent. On
  the production stage every critical risk needs an explicit answer: an API
  call with no `resolutions` gets `409 DESTRUCTIVE_CHANGE_UNRESOLVED` instead
  of the defaults. **API scripts deploying to production must send their
  resolutions.**
- **Accepted risks are kept with the deployment** — what was at stake, what
  was chosen, and an optional reason (`riskNote`), shown in its history.
- **The SQL preview follows the answers** given in the plan instead of showing
  the first draft.
- **Fixed:** a size change on a text column (`varchar(320)` → `varchar(255)`)
  was not seen by the deployment diff, so nothing was deployed.
- **Database change:** migration 24 adds `accepted_risks` and `risk_note` to
  `deployment_history`. Automatic, one-way.

### Changed (environments) — read before upgrading

- **Environments are now configured stages**, not a free-text label on each
  connection. Admin → Environnements holds the chain (name, colour, order,
  protection) and at most one **production** stage. Migration 23 turns every
  label already in use into a stage (one per distinct label, ignoring case),
  guesses the order (dev first, production last) and flags as production the
  label that reads as such (`prod`, `production` — not `preprod`); an
  instance with no labels gets DEV › Staging › Prod. **Check the result in
  Admin → Environnements after upgrading.** Deployment history keeps the names
  it recorded.
- **Deploying to, or rolling back on, the production stage asks for the
  connection's name** — in the app (a retype dialog) and in the API:
  `POST /api/v1/…/deploy` and `…/rollback` answer `409
PRODUCTION_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` unless the body carries
  `"confirmName": "<connection name>"`. **Scripts that deploy to a connection
  labelled "production" through the API need that field after the upgrade.**
- **A connection's `environment` must name an existing stage** (or send
  `environmentId`); an unknown name is refused with `404
ENVIRONMENT_NOT_FOUND` instead of being stored as typed.
- **Database change:** migration 23 adds the `environments` table and
  `db_connections.environment_id`. Automatic, one-way.

### Added (history)

- **The history reads as a timeline.** Newest first; edits made close together
  by one person are one line ("3 étapes", expandable), each with the tables it
  touched; a "Mes modifications" filter; lock changes, restores and — for
  project administrators — deployments and rollbacks appear among the
  revisions.
- **Preview on the diagram.** "Aperçu sur le graphe" outlines on the canvas the
  tables added (green) or changed (orange) since a revision, and names those
  deleted since. The preview follows edits made meanwhile.
- **Restore one table.** From a revision's list of changes or from the preview,
  a single table can be put back as it was — the rest of the schema stays as it
  is now. Its own foreign keys come back with it. A locked table still refuses
  it. `POST /api/projects/:id/revisions/:revisionId/restore` takes an optional
  `{ "tableIds": [...] }`.
- **Fixed:** revision times in the history were shown as if UTC were local time
  (two hours early in Paris in summer).
- No database or configuration change. The undo stack (`Ctrl+Z`) is now
  capped at 200 steps per session.

### Added (drift)

- **The editor says when a linked database was changed outside the schema.**
  After a table or index change made from the console (policies "Avertir" and
  "Libre"), every project modelling that database shows a banner, with — for
  its administrators — the number of differences and the choice to view them,
  resynchronise the schema from the database, or dismiss. A deployment or a
  pull clears it. Changes made by other tools are not detected yet.
- **Database change:** migration 22 adds the `schema_fingerprints` table and
  two columns on `project_connection_links`. Automatic, one-way.

### Changed (database console) — read before upgrading

- **On a database that a project models, the console no longer changes tables
  or indexes by default.** Dropping a table or a column from the explorer, or
  running `CREATE / ALTER / DROP TABLE|INDEX` in the SQL console, is refused
  and points to the project instead: the change is made in the schema and
  deployed. This applies as soon as the instance is upgraded, to every
  connection attached to at least one project. To get the previous behaviour
  back, an instance administrator sets **Admin → Connexions → Structure des
  bases liées à un projet** to "Libre" (or "Avertir": allowed after
  confirmation, and logged as done outside the schema). Each connection can
  also have its own setting. Connections attached to no project, data
  statements, views, functions and whole databases are unaffected.
- **Database change:** migration 21 adds the `instance_settings` table and two
  columns on `db_connections`. Automatic, one-way.
- **API:** `POST /api/admin/connections/:id/query` and `…/drop` can now answer
  `409` with `STRUCTURE_VIA_SCHEMA` or `STRUCTURE_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`.

### Added (table locks)

- **A project administrator can lock a table.** Its structure — name, columns,
  types, constraints, indexes, the foreign keys it carries, and its deletion —
  is then frozen for everyone else, on every way of writing a schema: canvas,
  DBML editor, import, history restore, pull from a database and `/api/v1`.
  Moving, recolouring and commenting stay open. An instance administrator can
  place a lock that only instance administrators can lift. Who can do what is
  now written down in `docs/permissions.md`.
- **Database change:** migration 20 adds the `table_locks` table. Automatic,
  one-way; nothing to do by hand.
- **API:** a write that touches a locked table now answers `403` with code
  `TABLE_LOCKED` and the list of tables (`tables`). Scripts that import into a
  project with locks should expect it.

### Fixed (database connections)

- **Pulling a schema from a database lost its relations.** Tables were given
  new ids while the relations kept the ones from the introspection, so every
  relation pointed at a table that did not exist. Relations now follow their
  tables, on a first pull and on later ones.

### Changed (interface)

- **The app's own form controls.** Dropdowns, menus, checkboxes, switches,
  number fields, confirmation dialogs and transient messages are now drawn by
  the app (`apps/web/src/components/ui/`) rather than by the browser, so they
  look the same on every platform and work from the keyboard. First screens
  using them: the DBML editor's behaviour settings and the editor switches in
  Settings; the others follow screen by screen. No database or configuration
  change.

### Fixed (DBML editor)

- **Hand edits no longer get "rolled back".** Retargeting a `Ref:` by hand
  could bring the old relation back next to the new one (when typing paused on
  a half-written table name), and a buffer using `<` or an inline `[ref: …]`
  was replaced wholesale by the generated layout — comments included — after
  every sync. The buffer now wins while it is the newer of the two, and a
  relation is recognised however it is written. No database or configuration
  change.

### Added (canvas)

- **Copy / paste tables** with `Ctrl/Cmd+C` / `Ctrl/Cmd+V` or the canvas
  context menu — within a project, between projects and tabs, and as DBML
  text into the DBML editor. Colours, columns, indexes and settings are kept;
  the copy is named `<name>_copy` (`_copy2`, … when taken) and relations
  between copied tables follow them. `Ctrl+D` now picks a free name the same
  way instead of creating a second `<name>_copy`.

### Added (DBML editor)

- **Editor behaviour settings** (⚙ in the editor's status bar, stored per
  browser): automatic formatting (never by default, or on save), completion
  while typing, bracket closing, and the delay before the text is sent to the
  diagram — including "only on Ctrl+S". The status bar now shows whether the
  text and the diagram agree (`Synced` / `Pending` / `Error on line n`).

### Added (database administration)

- **Instance-level database connections.** Connections are now created,
  edited and deleted by an instance administrator in **Admin → Database
  connections**, then attached to the projects that may use them — one
  connection can serve several projects. Oracle joins PostgreSQL,
  MySQL/MariaDB, SQL Server and SQLite in the form. Each connection has tags,
  a reachability status (checked on demand and in the background) and an
  optional **read-only** flag that makes NebulaDB refuse to write through it.
  **Database:** migration 18 moves `project_connections` to `db_connections`
  - `project_connection_links` (ids preserved, deployment history kept).
    **Behaviour change:** through a project (web or `/api/v1`), deleting a
    connection now detaches it, and a connection created by an instance admin
    can be used but not edited. **Config:**
    `NEBULADB_CONNECTION_HEALTH_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default 15, `0` = off).
- **Database console** for each connection (instance administrators only):
  an explorer (databases, schemas, tables, paged data with CSV export,
  structure), a SQL console (read-only by default; write mode is explicit,
  confirmed, time- and row-capped; per-admin history), drop of a column,
  table, view or database behind a SQL preview and the object's name typed
  back, and a session monitor with kill. Everything is recorded in the audit
  log. **Database:** migration 19 adds `admin_query_history`.
- **Database users and permissions.** List the target server's accounts and
  roles and what they are granted; create, drop, lock, change a password,
  manage role membership, grant and revoke — each shown as SQL before it
  runs. Covers PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB (`user@host`), SQL Server (logins
  and database users) and Oracle; SQLite has no accounts. Passwords are never
  stored or logged.
- Also in this release, previously unlisted: **New project from database**,
  **table duplication** on the canvas, and **Check differences** between a
  project and a connected database.

### Security

- **DNS rebinding closed for database connections.** The target host is
  resolved once, checked, and the driver connects to that exact address
  (host/port configs and PostgreSQL/MySQL URLs). A host hidden in a
  connection string used to skip the metadata-endpoint check entirely; it no
  longer does, for any engine.
- **A project administrator could act on another project's connection** by
  knowing its id (update, delete, pull, plan, deploy). Project routes now
  only resolve connections attached to that project.
- **Encryption key rotation.** Stored secrets carry a format version, and
  `NEBULADB_SECRET_PREVIOUS` + `npm run rotate-secret` re-encrypt everything
  under a new `NEBULADB_SECRET`. Existing data stays readable as is.
- **`NEBULADB_SQLITE_DIR`** restricts SQLite connections to one directory
  (opt-in; symlinks are resolved).
- The connection routes of the web UI now also have a per-caller rate limit.

### Added (API)

- **OpenAPI description of the public API** at `GET /api/v1/openapi.json`, for
  Postman, Swagger UI or generating a client. Kept in sync with the routes and
  `docs/public-api.md` by a test.

### Added (webhooks)

- **Webhooks.** A project can notify Slack, Discord or any HTTP endpoint when
  its schema changes (grouped after 30 s without edits) or a deployment
  finishes. JSON payloads are signed (HMAC-SHA256); failed deliveries are
  retried for about 9 hours. Managed by project administrators from the
  project card. See [`docs/webhooks.md`](docs/webhooks.md). **Database:**
  migration 17 adds `project_webhooks` and `webhook_deliveries`. Requires
  `NEBULADB_SECRET` (signing secrets are stored encrypted).

### Security

- **Deleting a project now deletes its database connections** (and their
  stored credentials), deployment history and project-restricted API keys.
  They used to be left behind. **Operators:** rows orphaned by earlier
  deletions remain — see the note in `docs/todo.md` (Phase 27) for the
  one-off cleanup query.

- **Per-database rate limit.** Operations against a connected database (test,
  pull, plan, deploy, rollback) are now capped per target database — 30 a
  minute, and 5 executed migrations/rollbacks a minute — whichever user, tab
  or API key they come from. Previously the web UI's connection routes had
  no limit at all.

### Fixed

- **Column defaults written as expressions** (`` default: `now()` ``) no longer
  turn into the string `'now()'` in the DBML panel, and `ALTER … SET DEFAULT`
  no longer quotes them. A string that merely looks like a call (`'now()'`)
  stays a string. Existing projects are corrected the next time their DBML is
  edited.
- **Foreign keys on the wrong table.** A relation written inline in DBML
  (`author_id integer [ref: > users.id]`, or `users.id [ref: < posts.author_id]`)
  was stored backwards: SQL export, migration SQL and **deployments** put the
  foreign key on the referenced table, and the canvas's "1/n" labels were
  swapped for relations written the explicit way. Every DBML spelling now
  means the same thing. **Existing projects are repaired automatically** the
  first time they are opened after upgrading — the fix appears in the project's
  history as "NebulaDB (sens des relations corrigé)". Only relations that are
  unambiguously inverted are touched. **If you deployed a schema from
  NebulaDB before this release, check its foreign keys.**

### Added

- **Search inside every schema.** The dashboard search box also finds tables,
  columns and enums by name across all the projects you can see; a result opens
  the project centred on that table.
- **Compare two projects.** _Compare_ in the editor shows name-matched
  differences with another project, and the migration SQL between them (5
  dialects, either direction).

- **Email, self-service password reset, emailed invitations.** Optional SMTP
  configuration (`NEBULADB_SMTP_*`, plus `NEBULADB_PUBLIC_URL` for the links —
  see the README's configuration table). With it set, invitations are emailed
  to the invitee, and the login page offers _Forgot your password?_: a
  single-use link valid for one hour, whose use signs out every session of the
  account and clears a login lockout. Without it, nothing changes — invitation
  links are still copied by hand. **Database:** migration 16 adds a
  `password_reset_tokens` table (hashes only). **Operators:** if your SMTP
  relay is a third-party service, it now processes users' email addresses —
  mention it in your privacy policy.

- **Project templates.** _From a template_ on the dashboard creates a project
  seeded with a starter schema — blog, e-commerce, multi-tenant SaaS or
  authentication — already related and laid out on the canvas. Also available
  over the API: `POST /api/projects` and `POST /api/v1/projects` accept an
  optional `template`.

- **Account offboarding.** Administrators can disable an account (reversible,
  kills its sessions and closes its live WebSockets immediately) or delete it
  permanently, choosing whether the projects it owns are transferred to another
  account or left ownerless. Previously there was no way to remove anyone's
  access short of changing their password.
- **Session management.** Users can see their own active sessions (device, IP,
  last activity) and revoke any of them individually, or log out everywhere
  else, from _Settings → Profile_.
- **Audit log.** Destructive and permission-shaped actions — project deletion,
  archiving, imports, exports, grant changes, team membership, password resets,
  account disable/delete, invitations, locked logins — are recorded and readable
  by administrators under _Admin console → Audit log_. Schema edits are not
  recorded here; they are already in each project's own revision history.
- **Per-account login lockout.** Ten failed attempts against one account locks
  it for fifteen minutes, complementing the existing per-IP rate limit which a
  slow or distributed attempt could stay under.
- **Error boundary.** A render-time exception now shows a recoverable error
  screen instead of a blank page, with a "back to my projects" path out of a
  crashed editor.
- **Per-account project cap** (500) as an abuse backstop, alongside the existing
  per-project entity limits.
- **Scheduled backups.** The server can now run the existing backup itself
  (`NEBULADB_BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS`, off by default), keeping the newest
  `NEBULADB_BACKUP_KEEP` runs and pruning the rest. The backup → restore round
  trip is now covered by tests, so it runs in CI rather than being first tried
  during an incident.
- **Personal data export and self-service account deletion.** _Settings →
  Profile_ can download everything the instance holds about you as JSON, and
  delete your account behind a password re-check. Projects you own are kept and
  left ownerless — they may be shared with a whole team.
- **Choosable session length.** "Stay signed in for 30 days" is on by default;
  unchecking it gives a 12-hour session in a cookie the browser drops when it
  closes.
- `NEBULADB_LOG_LEVEL`, plus redaction of session cookies and `Authorization`
  headers from logs.
- Loading placeholders on the dashboard.
- **Audit log retention.** `NEBULADB_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` (365 by default,
  `0` to keep everything) purges old entries on the hourly sweep. The audit
  table was the only one with no ceiling.
- **Legal templates** in `docs/legal/`: terms of service and a privacy policy
  written against what the software actually stores and for how long, with an
  index explaining that whoever runs an instance — not this project — is the
  operator and the data controller. Drafts, requiring review by a lawyer.
- `npm audit` runs in CI (non-blocking).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, this changelog, and a user guide
  (`docs/user-guide.md`).

### Changed

- **Write permissions are re-evaluated live.** A connection's write access used
  to be resolved once, when the WebSocket opened: downgrading someone to
  view-only, or removing them from a project, left them editing until they
  happened to reconnect. Access is now re-checked (immediately when a grant
  changes, otherwise at most 5 seconds later), and a user who has lost access
  entirely is disconnected.
- `GET /api/health` now queries the database and reports live room count and
  uptime, returning 503 if the database is unreachable. It previously returned
  `{"status":"ok"}` unconditionally, which the Docker `HEALTHCHECK` could not
  distinguish from a healthy server.
- Landing page, pricing and settings copy now describe what the product
  actually does: the unavailable hosted tier is marked as such rather than
  advertised with a price and a trial button, unbuilt enterprise features are
  marked planned rather than included, PDF export is no longer described as
  vector (it embeds a raster snapshot), and "local-first" was replaced with
  "self-hosted" — state lives on the server and the browser needs a connection
  to it.

- Every user-facing string is now French. The admin console, both password
  flows and the team modals were still English.

### Fixed

- **Memory leak in room eviction.** When the last client left a project, the
  room was dropped from the server's map but its `Awareness` instance kept a
  live `setInterval`, which kept the Y.Doc and the project's entire contents
  resident for the lifetime of the process — for every project ever opened.
- **Another account's project list could appear after re-login.** Nothing reset
  the dashboard's state across a logout, so signing in as a different user
  briefly rendered the previous user's projects from stale state.
- The dashboard told users with projects that they had none while the first
  request was still in flight — "empty" and "not loaded yet" were the same
  empty array.
- **Web fonts are now self-hosted.** They were loaded from
  `fonts.googleapis.com`, so every visitor's browser disclosed its IP address
  and user agent to a third party — while the app claimed to depend on no
  external service. The latin and latin-ext subsets ship with the app (244 kB);
  the design is unchanged and the page now makes no third-party requests at
  all.

### Upgrade notes

- Migrations 3–7 run on first boot: `users.disabled_at`,
  `sessions.user_agent`/`sessions.ip`/`sessions.ttl_ms`, and the new
  `login_attempts` and `audit_log` tables. No manual step is required.
- New optional environment variables, all with safe defaults that preserve
  current behaviour: `NEBULADB_LOG_LEVEL`, `NEBULADB_BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS`
  (backups stay off unless set), `NEBULADB_BACKUP_DIR`, `NEBULADB_BACKUP_KEEP`.
