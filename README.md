# NebulaDB

Self-hosted DBML schema editor with real-time collaboration, history, and a workbench for the databases it models. Your data stays on your server.

## Run it

Node 22–25 and Docker Desktop (or your own PostgreSQL 13+, via `NEBULADB_DATABASE_URL`).

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # one file: set NEBULADB_POSTGRES_PASSWORD and NEBULADB_SECRET
npm install
npm run db:up             # PostgreSQL in Docker, localhost:5433 (NEBULADB_POSTGRES_PORT)
npm run build
npm run bootstrap-admin -- you@example.com 'a-strong-password'   # first admin, once
npm run dev               # server :3001 (PORT) + web http://localhost:5173 (NEBULADB_WEB_PORT)
```

**One `.env`.** Only the two values above are needed; everything reads this file (`npm run dev`, `npm start`, the server scripts, `npm run db:up`, `docker compose`). The server derives its database URL from `NEBULADB_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `NEBULADB_POSTGRES_PORT`; the web dev proxy follows `PORT`. Change a port in `.env` and everything follows. The password is fixed when the database volume is first created: change it later in the database too (`ALTER USER nebuladb PASSWORD '…'`).

**The database runs in the background.** `npm run db:up` starts only the PostgreSQL container, waits until it accepts connections, then gives the terminal back; closing the terminal does not stop it. Docker restarts it with Docker Desktop, so after a reboot it is usually already up (running `db:up` again is harmless). `npm run db:down` stops it; the data stays in the `nebuladb-postgres` volume. Only `npm run dev` keeps a terminal busy (Ctrl+C stops it, not the database).

Day to day: `npm run db:up` (if Docker Desktop was closed), then `npm run dev`.

Production (one process, one port; the server also serves the web app):

```bash
npm run build
npm start                 # http://localhost:3001 (PORT)
```

Docker, app included (its own PostgreSQL; data in the `nebuladb-postgres` and `nebuladb-data` volumes; same `.env`, app published on `PORT`). Stop `npm run dev` first, both use `PORT`:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Other accounts are created by invitation from the admin console.

## Configuration

Environment variables, or the root `.env` (see [`.env.example`](.env.example); an optional `apps/server/.env` overrides it for the server only). Invalid values stop the server at boot with a `[config]` message.

## Operations

**Single process.** Data lives in PostgreSQL, but each open project's live document lives in the server's memory: never run two instances on the same database.

**Moving from SQLite.** Releases before PostgreSQL kept everything in one SQLite file (`./data/nebuladb.sqlite`, or `/data/nebuladb.sqlite` in Docker). Start the last SQLite release on it once so it is up to date, stop it, point `NEBULADB_DATABASE_URL` at a new, empty PostgreSQL database, then:

```bash
npm run migrate-from-sqlite -- ./data/nebuladb.sqlite
```

Every table is copied in one transaction; the tool refuses a file at another schema version and a database that already holds data. The SQLite file is only read: keep it as a backup.

**Reverse proxy.** Terminate TLS and set `NEBULADB_COOKIE_SECURE=true`, forward the WebSocket on `/ws/`, and keep the `Host` header (or set `NEBULADB_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`). Pass the client address in `X-Forwarded-For` and set `NEBULADB_TRUST_PROXY=1` (or the proxy's address): otherwise every client shares the proxy's IP, and one script hitting the login limit locks everyone out.

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3001;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
}
```

**Backup / restore.**

```bash
npm run backup [-- <dir>]                       # every project to .dbml files
npm run restore -- <dir> [--owner <email>]      # each file becomes a new project
```

**Logs and retention.** What NebulaDB keeps, and for how long. Purges run at boot and then hourly.

| Log (table)                                     | Kept                                    | Setting                                   |

| Database activity (`db_activity`)               | 14 days                                 | `NEBULADB_DB_ACTIVITY_RETENTION_DAYS`     |

| Webhook deliveries (`webhook_deliveries`)       | 30 days                                 | fixed                                     |
| Server errors (`error_log`)                     | the last 2,000                          | fixed                                     |
| Connection health samples (`db_health_samples`) | 7 days                                  | fixed                                     |
| SQL console history (`admin_query_history`)     | the last 200 entries                    | fixed                                     |
| Notifications (`notifications`)                 | the last 200 per user                   | fixed                                     |
| Drift events (`drift_events`)                   | never purged (removed with the project) | none                                      |
| Deployment history (`deployment_history`)       | never purged (removed with the project) | none                                      |
| Application logs (pino, stdout)                 | not stored by NebulaDB                  | see below                                 |

`0` means keep everything where a setting accepts it.

**Log rotation.** The application logs are JSON on stdout and NebulaDB does not rotate them: the host does. In Docker, `docker-compose.yml` caps them with the `json-file` driver (`max-size: "10m"`, `max-file: "5"`); on another setup use `docker logs --log-opt max-size=…` when you `docker run`, journald (`SystemMaxUse=`, `journalctl --vacuum-time=30d`) or your process manager's own rotation.

**Upgrading from AthanorDB:** the old `ATHANORDB_*` variables are still read when the `NEBULADB_*` one is not set; rename them when convenient.

```
apps/server     Fastify + WebSocket server, PostgreSQL storage, database drivers
apps/web        Svelte 5 app: canvas (Svelte Flow), DBML editor, SQL space, admin
packages/shared       Schema model, protocol, Yjs binding
packages/dbml-engine  DBML ⇄ SQL ⇄ model conversion, diff, validation, lint
```

The server tests need the throwaway PostgreSQL of `docker-compose.test.yml` (each test file gets a database of its own on it, dropped afterwards):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d nebuladb-test-postgres
npm run build -w apps/server && npm test -w apps/server
```

`NEBULADB_TEST_PG_HOST` / `_PORT` / `_USER` / `_PASSWORD` / `_DATABASE` point them elsewhere. Tests of the other engines (MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle) skip themselves unless their containers run (`docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d`).
