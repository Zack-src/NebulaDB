# NebulaDB — TODO

DBML-native, self-hosted, multi-user, versioned, visual editor — and, since the database
console, a workbench for the databases it models.

Legend: `[ ]` todo, `[~]` in progress/partially done, `[x]` done. Every open item follows the
same shape — **What** it means, concretely, **How** to build it (files, approach), and
**Blocked by** when something else has to land first. Effort tags: **S** (hours), **M** (a
day or two), **L** (about a week), **XL** (a project of its own).

**Reorganised 2026-10-02.** Phases 0–28 predate this pass and keep their numbers (code and
docs refer to them, e.g. "the Phase 27 rule"); finished work in them is condensed to one
line — `git log --follow -p -- docs/todo.md` recovers the detail. **Phases 29–38 are new**:
the schema ↔ database workbench roadmap, whose design (mock-ups, data model, open
questions) was kept in a plan document that has since been removed — every
item below cites the section (`§n`) it came from. The database console it builds on has shipped.

Before starting any phase, check the **Prerequisites** list just below — and the **Owner's
checklist** after it: the decisions to take, the tests to run by hand and the checks owed
before the next round of changes, gathered in one place.

## Roadmap at a glance

Suggested order (each lot depends only on lots above it — see the plan's §20 for the
dependency table). Lot numbers are the plan's. `✔` = done, `◐` = usable, remainder listed in its
phase (2026-10-02: lot 1, the copy / paste item, lot 2's tokens + form components — built
in-house; `DataGrid` and `Splitter` are still owed and block lot 6, not lots 3–5 — and lot 3:
locks enforced on every write path, with a first editor UI; 2026-10-03: lot 18's timeline,
diagram preview and per-table restore; lot 11's logical backups and restore — its deployment
rollback is still to do; 2026-10-04: lot 17's schema linter and data dictionary).

| Order | Lot | Phase | What                                                             |

| 24    | 23  | 37    | Visual overhaul, screen by screen (runs alongside everything)    |

### Prerequisites to settle before coding (cross-cutting)

- [x] **Role / permission matrix** — written 2026-10-02 (the document has since been removed),
      role × action, taken from the guards in the code. It also lists what no role covers today
      (no level between `edit` and `administrator`, no read restriction inside a project, an
      all-or-nothing database console) — the gaps Phases 31, 32 and 35 will have to fill. Keep
      it in step with the guards: a route that changes its guard changes this page.
- [x] **Stable ids for schema objects** — verified 2026-10-02. **Tables: stable.** A table
      keeps its id across a canvas rename, the DBML round trip (`mergeProjectIntoExisting`
      matches by name, then recovers a renamed table by its columns when the match is
      unambiguous), a history restore and a pull from a database. **Columns: stable on the
      canvas only.** A column renamed in the DBML text, or any column after a pull, gets a new
      id. So table locks are keyed by table id and compare columns by name
      (`packages/shared/src/tableLocks.ts`); **per-column locks, and rename detection in
      Phase 32 / 35, still need a column identity that survives the text** — not solved.
- [x] **Schema fingerprint** — done 2026-10-02. `packages/dbml-engine/src/schemaHash.ts`:
      `fingerprintSchema(project)` → canonical structure with a hash per table and one for the
      whole; `diffFingerprints(a, b)` → tables added / removed / changed. Canonical means:
      engine aliases unified (`int4` = `integer`, `character varying` = `varchar`…), defaults
      stripped of quoting and casts, a primary key or unique constraint the same thing whether
      declared on the column or as an index, `NO ACTION` = nothing; and **not** part of it:
      order, letter case, index / constraint names, notes, everything visual. Versioned
      (`FINGERPRINT_VERSION`) — bump it when the canonical form changes; a stored fingerprint
      of another version is ignored rather than compared. The hash is a small non-cryptographic
      one (identical in the browser and Node): this is change detection, not tamper evidence.
      **Strict where `diffTargetAgainstLive` is lenient, on purpose:** that diff equates
      `varchar(255)` and `text` because it compares hand-written DBML with what an engine
      reports; the fingerprint compares a database with itself later, where
      `varchar(255)` → `varchar(320)` must be seen. So: fingerprint for database ↔ database
      (drift since the reference, before / after a deployment, two environments), the lenient
      diff for schema ↔ database. First consumer: the drift banner (Phase 30). **Not done:**
      views / functions / accounts are outside it, like the rest of the model; type aliases
      cover the common PostgreSQL / MySQL spellings, not every engine's — extend
      `TYPE_ALIASES` when a false "changed" shows up.
- [~] **Background job runner** — first version done 2026-10-03 with the watch (Phase 34):
  `infrastructure/scheduler.ts` (`scheduleJob`: no overlap, never throws, `unref`ed, last run
  kept — `listJobs`). Used by the drift watch and the backup retention sweep. **Not done:** the
  older timers (health checks, the app's own backups, the session sweep) are not on it; state
  is in memory, not in a table; a _long_ job with progress and cancel is each feature's own
  (the backup runner has one, `modules/backups/runner.ts`) rather than a shared mechanism.
- [ ] **Capability levels per connection** — **S**. Level 0 (catalogue read), 1 (supervision
      views), 2 (server-side audit configured) — detected at connection test and stored on
      `db_connections` (`plan §8.3`). Journal, traffic, advisor and drift attribution all branch on it.
      **Left alone on purpose (2026-10-05):** detecting levels 1 and 2 is one probe per engine
      (`pg_stat_activity`, `performance_schema`, DMVs, `V$SESSION`…), none of which can be
      run on a machine with only SQLite — and nothing reads the level yet. Build it with its
      first consumer, on a machine with the engines.
- [ ] **Migrations** — PostgreSQL numbering: the SQLite history is the baseline (`schema_migrations` version 1) and the next number is **13** (the last one, 12, is `table_seeds.storage`). Every item below that adds a table
      gets its own migration, tested on a populated database (`infrastructure/migrations.test.ts`).
      Reminder from `memory`: saving `migrations.ts` while `npm run dev` runs migrates the real dev
      DB, one way — work on a copy.

## Owner's checklist — to decide, to test, to verify (as of 2026-10-05)

Everything below waits for **the owner**, not for code. It gathers in one place what the phases
further down say in passing, so nothing has to be found again before the next round of changes.
Each line names the phase that has the detail. **Keep it current:** an item settled here is
struck through with its date and its answer, and a new decision, an unverified path or a check
owed goes here the day it appears — as well as in its phase.

### A. Decisions to take

Marked **(blocks)** when code is waiting on the answer; the others have a default in place that
the answer may change.

**Taken by default during the 2026-10-04 / 05 work — confirm or change:**

- [ ] **Personal database accounts: option, default, or the only mode?** Built as an option per
      connection; existing and new connections are `shared`. Choose: keep it an option · make
      `personal` the default for new connections · remove the shared mode (then every existing
      connection needs each user's account before anyone can use it). _Phase 27._
- [ ] **Personal accounts: is a service account acceptable for unattended work?** The watch,
      scheduled backups and the availability check run as the account stored on the connection,
      so those reads are **not** attributed to a person in the database's logs — including a
      watch check or a health check started by hand. Alternative: a hand-started check uses the
      person's account (and fails without one). _Phase 27._
- [ ] **Personal accounts: who may give one?** Today instance administrators, administrators
      of a project the connection is attached to, and (since 2026-10-06) members granted access
      to that database — the people who can act on the database at all. _Phase 27 / 31._
- [ ] **Lint rule `personal-data-class`: its default level.** Warning in Standard, **error in
      Strict** — so a Strict project that refuses deployments on errors is refused after
      upgrading while a personal column sits in an unclassified table. Choose: keep · make it a
      warning in Strict too · off by default. _Phase 36._
- [ ] **Lint rules `column-description` and `fk-on-delete`:** off except in Strict (info).
      Confirm, or raise them. _Phase 36._
- [ ] **Webhook secret rotation: no grace period.** The old secret stops signing at once. A
      window where both sign would avoid rejected deliveries during the switch, at the price of
      a second stored secret. _Phase 21._
- [ ] **Write-mode SQL on the production stage:** confirmed by a dialog, without retyping the
      connection's name — unlike a deployment. Align them? _Phase 30 / 32._
- [ ] **Capability levels per connection:** left unbuilt until something reads them, and until
      a machine with the engines is available. Confirm that order. _Prerequisites._

**Open since before — product and release:**

- [ ] **Licence (blocks the release):** MIT or AGPL. Decide before any outside contribution.
      _V1 checklist._
- [ ] **Is there a hosted product?** Pulls billing, tenancy and an SLA into scope, and weighs on
      the licence. _Open decisions._
- [ ] **First tagged release:** when, and from which commit. _V1 checklist / Phase 25._
- [ ] **Mobile / tablet:** desktop-only stated in writing, or responsive. _Phase 22._
- [ ] **Language policy:** fr + en, both complete — written down as the rule. _V1 checklist._
- [ ] **Out of V1, said plainly:** passkeys, offline mode, plugin marketplace — confirm the
      list the user guide ends with. _V1 checklist._

**Open since before — features (each blocks its item):**

- [x] ~~**(blocks)** **SQL for members with `edit`**~~ — answered 2026-10-06 by the owner,
      differently: not a project role but **database access granted by an instance
      administrator**, per user or per team, `read` or `write` (data only), structure never.
      Built; its defaults are the next block. _Phase 31._
- [ ] **(blocks)** **A relation pointing the "wrong" way:** is a heuristic wanted at all? A
      false warning on a legitimate schema is worse than none. _Phase 29._
- [ ] **(blocks)** **Waypoints on a relation line:** needs the owner's hands on the canvas, or a
      steer, before a redesign. _Phase 29._
- [ ] **Drift:** watch data too (rows of a locked table)? Refuse deployments while a drift is
      open? Today: structure only, deployments not blocked. _Phase 34._
- [ ] **History:** retention / compaction of detailed revisions; does undoing a deployed change
      propose a new deployment? _Phase 31._
- [ ] **Backups:** who pays for storage; legal retention of backups that hold personal data;
      should a restore consult table locks; a dedicated `backup.restore` right; double approval
      on production. _Phase 32._
- [ ] **Pipeline:** what `review` protection means (required approval — today enforced like
      `protected`); deployment windows and freeze. _Phase 32._
- [ ] **Variants (Phase 35), before any code:** DBML export of a variant (resolved, or base +
      patch); may a variant add a seed to a table locked in the base; hierarchy depth; do
      variants cover "schema branches" (Phase 38 idea 31).
- [ ] **AI features:** may a provider ever see anonymised samples? Today: structure only.
      _Phase 33._
- [ ] **Database-side logs:** default retention; syslog / SIEM export. **Traffic:** accept an
      estimate for PostgreSQL's data volume? _Phase 34._
- [ ] **`NEBULADB_SQLITE_DIR` as the default:** a breaking change to schedule. A general
      private-IP block: done for webhooks (on by default, `NEBULADB_WEBHOOK_BLOCK_PRIVATE`,
      `NEBULADB_WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_HOSTS`); still open for database connections. _Phase 27._
- [ ] **Roles beyond view / edit / administrator:** only on real demand — say when. _Phase 20._
- [ ] **Visual overhaul:** before the new features or alongside them; Figma mock-ups first?
      _Phase 37._
- [ ] **Phase 38:** some thirty candidate ideas, none arbitrated — cut or promote, one by one.

**Found on the 2026-10-05 re-read of the unpushed commits — also open:**

- [ ] **Deployment safety extras:** pre-deploy impact analysis, deployment windows and one-click
      freeze, review before deploy (1–2 approvers) — three small items nobody arbitrated.
      _Phase 32 / 38._
- [ ] **Seeds:** (size past 2 MB / 50 000 rows is done: files on the server, read as streams;) what happens to a mapping when
      a column is renamed in the DBML text; a DBML annotation for seeds that stays valid DBML
      (today a seed is not in the DBML at all). _Phase 33._
- [ ] **Field-level merge inside one table** (two people editing different columns of the same
      table: last write wins) touches the same code as the lock enforcement — decide both
      together, or leave both. _Phase 6 / 30._
- [ ] **Query advisor, before any code:** a multi-dialect SQL parser (`node-sql-parser`) or an
      in-house analyser limited to `SELECT`; may non-administrators see recommendations.
      _Phase 36._
- [ ] **`/api/v1` scopes of the routes added since 2026-10-04:** a watch check and a database
      comparison are behind `projects:read` (they only read, but they open connections);
      webhook changes and "send a test" behind `projects:write`. No dedicated scope was
      created. Confirm, or ask for `connections:manage` / a new scope. _Phase 21 / 34._

**Taken by the 2026-10-05 parallel work (four sub-agents) — confirm or change:**

- [ ] **Backups in `/api/v1` sit behind `connections:manage`.** With it, an instance
      administrator's key can download every row of a connected database — more than the
      scope's name says. Alternative: a dedicated `backups:manage` scope. Start and download
      are limited to 10 a minute (the app's own routes allow 20). _Phase 32._
- [ ] **Restore, the backup schedule and the pin are not in the API**, on purpose. Confirm, or
      ask for them (a restore by API would need the target's name in the body). _Phase 32._
- [ ] **Pushed notifications reach only the project that is open.** Someone on another
      project or on the dashboard still waits up to a minute. The signal is a module-level
      state every mounted bell listens to, and `Room.join` takes the user id as an optional
      argument (a caller that forgets it gets no push — it fails closed). _Phase 34._
- [ ] **Controls that changed when they left the native ones:** a webhook's "Actif" is a switch
      (it acts at once); "Ajouter à un rôle…" in the database users panel is a placeholder,
      so a picked role cannot be set back to "none"; the port field shows 0 as empty; several
      pickers have a fixed width and get a search field past 8 options. _Phase 29._

**Taken by default with database access for members (2026-10-06) — confirm or change:**

- [ ] **Two levels per connection**, `read` and `write` (data only), for a user or a team; the
      highest wins; never derived from a project. Not per database / schema / table on the
      server; no "structure" level. _Phase 31._
- [ ] **A grant on a shared-account connection** runs as the connection's stored account: only
      Nebula's own screening (read-only rules; data statements only) bounds the member, not the
      database's permissions. Alternative: allow `write` (or any grant) only on connections in
      personal-account mode. _Phase 31 / 27._
- [ ] **Where a member reaches it:** from a project the database is attached to (Données & SQL,
      `Ctrl+J`), from a browser session only — not with an API key, not from a page of its own;
      fixed ceilings (1 000 rows, 30 s). _Phase 31._
- [ ] **Member writes:** one data statement at a time, confirmed (`confirmWrite`); `TRUNCATE`,
      procedure calls, `SELECT … INTO` and any DDL refused even under the `free` structure
      policy; no name to retype on the production stage (as for the administrator, item above).
      _Phase 31._
- [ ] **The connection's own account is protected** from drop / lock / password change in the
      console, for administrators too, with no override. _Phase 27._

**Taken by the 2026-10-06 parallel work — confirm or change:**

- [ ] **Plugins on a locked table say "done" when it was refused.** The lock holds everywhere,
      but a plugin's own success message shows next to the refusal ("Timestamps ajoutés dans
      2 table(s)" while nothing was added). And two behaviours coexist: a canvas plugin applies
      the unlocked part and the server puts the locked part back; a DBML-editor plugin and an
      importer are refused whole. Choose one behaviour, and whether a plugin's message is
      shown when its change was reverted. _Phase 17 / 30._
- [ ] **Risk strategies in the deployment dialog are plain radio buttons now**, with the
      description under the label — they were bordered cards that lit up when chosen. Nobody
      looked at the result. Keep, or ask for the cards back as a `RadioGroup` variant.
      _Phase 29._
- [ ] **Pickers with an empty first entry became placeholders** (team to assign, member to
      add, project to compare): once a value is picked, "nothing" cannot be chosen again from
      the list. _Phase 29._
- [ ] **Result grid:** 28 px rows; columns sized to their content and no longer stretched;
      widths not remembered; sort only on the page shown. Say which of these matter. _Phase 29._
- [ ] **Personal accounts by API sit behind `connections:manage`**, the `GET` included, and a
      project-restricted key is allowed on its own project's connections only (see Phase 27).
      The app's route and the API's each allow 10 attempts a minute, so 20 through both.
      _Phase 27._
- [ ] **The CI example stops on an unreachable database and on a drift already known**, not
      only on a new one: `result.changes` counts a change the first time it is seen and is 0
      on the next check while the event is still open. Is that the behaviour wanted from
      `result.changes`, or should the check also answer the number of open events? _Phase 34._

**Decided on the owner's behalf since 2026-10-02 — read once, object where needed.** Each is
written up under "Decisions taken" in its phase; none was confirmed by the owner. Unticked means
"not reviewed yet", not "to do".

- [ ] _Phase 29:_ form components built in-house, no headless UI dependency. Canvas paste: a
      relation to a table that was not copied is dropped; comments are not copied.
- [ ] _Phase 30, locks:_ `structure` and `full` are enforced alike (deletion frozen at both);
      a lock is per table, never per column; an `instance` lock can only be lifted by an
      instance administrator; a project administrator may still edit a table under a project
      lock.
- [ ] _Phase 30, structure policy:_ per connection with an instance default; **the default is
      `schema-only` and applies on upgrade**; only for a database a project models; views,
      functions and triggers are not intercepted.
- [ ] _Phase 31:_ URLs stay `/project/:id/:tab`; a tab the role may not see falls back to
      Schéma; the other tabs replace the editor (the canvas selection is lost on a round trip).
      History: edits grouped within 2 min / 15 min; on a partial restore a foreign key follows
      the table that carries it.
- [ ] _Phase 32, environments:_ at most one production stage (an instance may have none); a
      free-text name from an older client is refused, not turned into a stage; a project
      administrator may choose a connection's stage.
- [ ] _Phase 32, pipeline:_ a card, not a tab; "promote" is "deploy the same schema to the next
      stage"; a stage is level on structure alone (a changed seed or note does not put it
      behind); skipping a stage is for instance administrators, with a reason.
- [ ] _Phase 32, variables:_ table names and schemas only; values limited to identifier
      characters; a connection without a stage cannot take a schema with placeholders.
- [ ] _Phase 32, risks:_ on production every critical risk needs an explicit answer; a risk
      left on "cancel" refuses the whole deployment.
- [ ] _Phase 32, backups:_ instance administrators only; one JSON-Lines file, encrypted;
      **not a consistent snapshot** (tables read one after another); a production deployment
      backs up first and **is refused if the backup fails**; 512 MB ceiling before compression.
- [ ] _Phase 32, restore:_ data only; the target's name retyped for every target, not only
      production; a safety backup first; same engine only.
- [ ] _Phase 33, seeds:_ stored in the app database, keyed by table id; `if-empty` by default;
      reading a table as a seed is for instance administrators.
- [ ] _Phase 33, generator:_ in-house (no Faker), 10 000 rows at most, no direct insertion into
      a database.
- [ ] _Phase 34:_ the Errors tab stays apart from Activité; the watch is structure only, off by
      default, and does not block deployments; notifications are opt-in per project and per
      event, never about one's own action, and a schema edit is not an event.
- [ ] _Phase 36:_ lint exceptions and the dictionary live in the table's **note** (one line of
      DBML); only `error` blocks a deployment, and only when the project asks; the dictionary's
      owner is free text, not an account.
- [ ] _V1, guided tour:_ no scrim, shown once per browser (not per account).

### B. Tests to run by hand (the code is written, nobody has seen it work)

**Needs real database servers** — the development machine has no Docker, so only SQLite was
exercised. `docker-compose.test.yml`, `docker-compose.mssql.yml` and `docker-compose.oracle.yml`
are in the repository for this.

- [ ] **Personal accounts — a real login**, on PostgreSQL and MySQL at least (then SQL Server,
      Oracle): give an account in "Mon compte SQL" → accepted and kept; a wrong password →
      refused with the database's message; deploy, pull, compare and run SQL → the database's
      own log shows **that** account; an account lacking a right → the database's refusal is
      shown; scheduled backup and watch → the service account. This is the one path of the
      feature no test covers. _Phase 27._
- [ ] **Backups and restore** on PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle: `queryRows` and the
      page query were only unit-tested as text. Check a 64-bit integer, a blob, NULL vs empty
      string, dates (SQL Server / Oracle go through JavaScript dates), identity columns and
      sequences after a restore. _Phase 32._
- [ ] **"Reprendre les lignes de la base"** (seed from a database) on the same four engines;
      Oracle dates through `NLS_DATE_FORMAT`. _Phase 33._
- [ ] **`{{schema}}` variables** on an engine that has schemas (PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
      _Phase 32._
- [ ] **Compare environments across two engines:** only as good as `TYPE_ALIASES` — expect
      false "different" and extend the aliases. _Phase 32._
- [ ] **The 6 tests the suite skips.** `npm test` reports "6 skipped" on a machine without the
      test containers: they are the live driver tests (PostgreSQL, MySQL… —
      `connections/drivers/*.test.ts`, `dbAdmin/drivers/live.test.ts`). "The suite is green"
      has meant "green without them" since 2026-10-02. Start `docker-compose.test.yml` (and the
      SQL Server / Oracle ones) and run them — first thing, before the items below.
- [ ] **Seed insertion (`insertRows`) and the deployment risk probes (`queryScalar`, one
      aggregate query per dialect)** on PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle: verified end to
      end on SQLite only, as text elsewhere — except `insertRows` on SQL Server
      (`drivers/mssql.test.ts`, seeds that give the ids of identity columns). _Phase 32 / 33._
- [ ] **BigQuery engine** (`drivers/bigquery.ts`, dialect `bigquery` in `migrationGenerator.ts`,
      `typeMapping.ts`): connection, plan, deployment, seeds, schema read-back — run for real
      on 2026-10-08 (a 126-table schema, 207 relations, 98 seeds, then a second plan that
      found nothing left). Rollback is generated and unit-tested, never executed there. The
      live test (`drivers/bigquery.test.ts`) needs a real dataset —
      `NEBULADB_TEST_BIGQUERY_PROJECT` / `_DATASET` / `_KEY` — there is no local BigQuery to
      start.
      The admin console has its driver (`dbAdmin/drivers/bigquery.ts`: explorer, SQL console,
      health, a backup of two tables — all run for real). Still open: a restore is untried; a
      deployment is one job per statement (slow on a large schema: group the constraints of a
      table, or send one script); arrays and structs read back as `ARRAY<…>` / `STRUCT` are not
      modelled; the dataset's region is read, never chosen. PostgreSQL / MySQL as targets of a
      schema written for SQL Server are better (`(max)`, `bit`, `GETDATE()`) but a full
      deployment there is still unverified (MySQL renumbers an id 0 unless
      `NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO`; PostgreSQL's sequence is not moved past seeded ids).
- [ ] **Auto-increment columns of a created table** (`formatColumnDef`, `identity`): the
      clause was deployed and checked on SQL Server only (126 tables, their seeds, then
      inserts without id); PostgreSQL, MySQL and Oracle are verified as text against the SQL
      export. Still open: a column **added** to an existing table gets no identity, the live
      diff does not compare `increment` (an existing table whose column is a plain integer is
      not reported), and PostgreSQL's sequence is not moved past seeded ids.
- [ ] **The watch and the drift check on a real engine:** the strict fingerprint depends on
      `TYPE_ALIASES`; a type spelling it does not know reads as a false "changed". _Phase 34._
- [ ] **The database users panel** (Admin → Connexions → a database → Utilisateurs): its
      five pickers were migrated without ever being displayed — SQLite has no users. Create a
      user, grant and revoke on PostgreSQL or MySQL. _Phase 29._
- [ ] **Destructive-change probes** on a very large table: a `COUNT(*)` may run until its 5 s
      cut-off. _Phase 32._

**Needs no database server:**

- [ ] **E-mail through a real SMTP relay:** one manual send (invitation or password reset) —
      never verified beyond the local test. _Phase 20._
- [ ] **Importing a schema from the connection form** (Admin → Connexions → a connection → a
      linked project → import): its confirmation dialog was type-checked, not clicked. _Phase 29._
- [ ] **Two performance regressions** flagged by a single bench pass (`zoom-links-on` at full
      detail, `delete-columns` at 500 tables): measure a second time. _Phase 23._
- [x] ~~**Plugins against table locks**~~ — automated 2026-10-06 (`e2e/plugins-locks.e2e.ts`:
      a DBML-editor command, a canvas command, a sandboxed plugin and an importer, as a user
      the lock binds, then as an administrator). The lock holds in all four; see block A for
      the two things it showed.
- [x] ~~**The connection form's fields, the schema import and its confirmation, a webhook's
      event checkboxes and switch**~~ — automated 2026-10-06 (`e2e/connection-form.e2e.ts`,
      `e2e/webhook-options.e2e.ts`). The first found a bug, fixed the same day: a connection
      saved by URI then switched to host and port kept its URI, and went on connecting to the
      old address.
- [ ] **Screens migrated on 2026-10-06 that no browser test clicks:** project teams (three
      pickers), delete user (transfer), errors filter, invitations ("Admin"), team members,
      API key scopes, backup codes, convert types, the import format, add index, "remember
      me" on the login page. Click through each once — or have the tests written (all can be
      automated on this machine). _Phase 29._
- [ ] **The result grid on a real result:** a wide table (30+ columns), a long text, a
      10 000-row result — scroll, sort, resize, export CSV. Unit tests and the catalogue's
      browser test cover the mechanism, nobody used it on real data. _Phase 29._
- [ ] **The CI example of `docs/public-api.md`:** run it once with a real `jq`, and the GitHub
      Actions job once in a repository. _Phase 36._
- [ ] **The deployment dialog after its split:** covered by ten browser tests, but nobody
      looked at it — open it once on each step (differences, risks, SQL, result, history).
      _Phase 23._

- [ ] **Scheduled backups over a few days:** hours are the **server's local time**; one
      catch-up after downtime; the kept-count. Tested with a simulated clock only. _Phase 32._
- [ ] **A backup past the size ceiling** (`NEBULADB_DATABASE_BACKUP_MAX_MB`, 512): it must
      fail, and a production deployment must then be refused — try it on a copy. _Phase 32._

### C. To verify before upgrading a real instance

Take a backup first (`npm run backup -- <dir>`); migrations are one-way. Try the upgrade on a
**copy** of the instance's database.

- [ ] **Migrations 20 → 36 on a copy of the real database** — each is tested on a small
      populated database, not on yours.
- [ ] **Structure policy defaults to `schema-only`:** table DDL from the console is refused on
      a connection attached to a project until an administrator relaxes it. _Phase 30._
- [ ] **Pipeline:** every stage reads "en retard" until deployed to once, and a production
      deployment is refused while an earlier stage of the same project lacks the schema.
      _Phase 32._
- [ ] **Lint:** see `personal-data-class` in block A — list the projects on Strict with
      "refuse a deployment on an error" before upgrading. _Phase 36._
- [ ] **`npm run rotate-secret`:** it now also re-encrypts personal accounts
      (`db_connection_credentials`); run it once on a copy if a rotation is planned.
- [ ] **One-off clean-up of orphan rows** from before the project-delete fix:
      `DELETE … WHERE project_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM projects)`. _Phase 27._
- [ ] **Environments (migration 23):** every free-text label became a stage, with a guessed
      order and a guessed production flag. **Check Admin → Environnements** — the order, and
      which stage is production. _Phase 32._
- [ ] **API scripts that deploy to production** must now send `confirmName` (the connection's
      name) and their `resolutions`: without them, `409 PRODUCTION_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` /
      `409 DESTRUCTIVE_CHANGE_UNRESOLVED`. A script sending a free-text `environment` gets
      `404 ENVIRONMENT_NOT_FOUND`. List the scripts and CI jobs concerned. _Phase 32._
- [ ] **Production deployments now back the database up first** and are refused if that fails:
      check the room on `NEBULADB_DATABASE_BACKUP_DIR` (default: next to the app database),
      the ceiling (`NEBULADB_DATABASE_BACKUP_MAX_MB`) against the size of the production
      databases, and the retention (`NEBULADB_DATABASE_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`). _Phase 32._
- [ ] **"Annuler / Gérer manuellement" on a risk now really cancels** the deployment: tell the
      people who used to click through it. _Phase 32._
- [ ] **`NEBULADB_SECRET`:** losing it now also loses the database backups, the personal
      accounts and the webhook secrets — check it is itself backed up, outside the instance.
- [ ] **The changelog's "read before upgrading" entries**, top to bottom.

### C bis. Before pushing

- [ ] **Every commit since `e0cde00` (2026-10-03) is on local `main` only** — some 180, see
      `git log origin/main..HEAD`: everything from Phase 29 on. Nothing of it is on the remote:
      a disk failure loses it. Push, or push to a branch, once blocks A–C have been read.
- [ ] **Last full run, 2026-10-06, on the last code commit (`6cbccab`, after the second
      round of sub-agents' work was integrated):** 615 unit tests pass, 6 skipped (see block
      B), 37 browser tests pass, ESLint and the circular-import check clean. Run it
      again if anything changes before the push: `npm run build`, `npm test`,
      `npm run test:e2e`, `npm run lint`.
- [ ] **One commit is red on its own:** `541def6` (webhook secret rotation) carries a test
      that calls the `/api/v1` routes added by the next commit, `8450675`. Together they are
      green; `git bisect` landing on the first one alone would see a failure. Squash the two
      before pushing, or accept it.
- [x] **No tag, every workspace still `0.0.1`:** done — `v1.0.0` is tagged and every workspace is
      at `1.0.0`. The changelog's "Unreleased" section still covers everything since.

### D. Reviews owed (the Phase 27 rule: before the item is closed, not after)

An **independent security review** — by someone who has not been staring at this code — is owed
for each of these; none has been done.

- [ ] Personal database accounts: which account every statement runs as; the request-scoped
      actor (`infrastructure/actor.ts`); the route that tries an account. _Phase 27._
- [ ] Table locks and their enforcement on every write path; the structure policy and its
      interception. _Phase 30._
- [ ] Environments and the production confirmation; pipeline and stage skip; per-environment
      variables; destructive-change detection; logical backups; restore. _Phase 32._
- [ ] Seeds and their deployment; reading a table as a seed. _Phase 33._
- [ ] Database users and permissions from the console (Phase F); the Ref-direction change,
      which altered deployment SQL — before the next real deployment. _Phase 27 / 28._
- [ ] What `sampleData` and the risk probes can leak across a permission boundary. _Phase 27._
- [ ] Database access for members: `requireDbConsoleUser` on every console route, the data-only
      screening (`sqlGuard.ts#assertDataStatement`), which account a member runs as on a shared
      connection, invitations granting on acceptance, the connection-account protection — before
      anyone is given `write`. _Phase 31._
- [ ] **Legal review** of the terms-of-service and privacy-policy templates (the templates were removed from the repository with `docs/legal/`; moot until they come back) — now including §2.8 (personal
      database accounts) and its retention line. _V1 checklist._
- [ ] **Accessibility audit** of the Svelte UI: none has been run. _Phase 22._

## V1 checklist (carried over from the retired `docs/v1-roadmap.md`)

The 2026-08-09 product audit (`v1-roadmap.md`) is gone: nearly every item in it shipped, and
what was left is below. **`0.y.z` stays until this list is clear, then `1.0.0` is tagged**
(`CHANGELOG.md` points here). The audit's conclusion still holds: no **L** item is required for
a credible V1; what costs most (DB link, public API, SSO) was V2 material — and the DB link and
API have since shipped.

- [x] **First tagged release** — **S**: `v1.0.0` tagged, every workspace at `1.0.0`.
- [ ] **Legal review of the templates** (removed from the repository with `docs/legal/`; moot until they come back) — not code. The terms-of-service and privacy-policy
      templates are written from the code's verified behaviour; the operator fills the `[…]` markers and
      has a lawyer read them. Remember: the instance operator, not this project, is publisher and
      data controller.
- [ ] **Decide the licence** — **S**, but decide **early**: MIT lets anyone host and resell the
      product, including against the announced hosted offer. Switching to AGPL touches two files
      while there are no outside contributors; much heavier afterwards. Tied to "Is there a hosted
      product?" in the open decisions.
- [x] **First-run onboarding** — the first version (done 2026-10-04: editor tour, four project templates) was
      removed with the workspace redesign (`a1d0b78`), and this entry stayed ticked. Rebuilt 2026-10-28 on the
      current workspace: a tour of the tabs (Schema, Deployments, History, Dictionary, Problems), the SQL
      console (`Ctrl+J`) and the palette (`Ctrl+K`), shown once per browser on the first project opened
      (`localStorage`, there is no server-side preference store) and replayable from the ⓘ button of the project
      header (`features/onboarding/`); four starter templates (documented example, blog, e-commerce, multi-tenant
      SaaS: `features/projects/templates/`, validated by a unit test) from the project list, applied through the
      ordinary DBML import; a first-project prompt on an empty list and a guide on an empty canvas (create a table,
      import, template). **Verified:** `e2e/onboarding.e2e.ts`, `e2e/project-templates.e2e.ts`. **Not done:** a
      getting-started checklist on the project list (the prompt covers it), "create from a database" on an
      existing empty project, the `/setup` wizard for the instance.
- [ ] **Written decisions** (cost one sentence if assumed): mobile / tablet (Phase 22), and
      the language policy (fr + en, see open decisions).
- [ ] **Out of V1, stated plainly rather than implied:** passkeys (TOTP 2FA and OpenID Connect SSO are
      done), real offline mode, plugin marketplace. Keep this list in sync with the product.

---

## Phase 29 — Editor reliability and UI foundations (plan §1, §2)

- [x] **DBML editor: edits get "rolled back" while typing** — fixed 2026-10-02. Reproduced
      first, then three causes found and closed (`features/editor/dbml/bufferSync.ts`):
  1. **Baseline advanced on send, not on success.** A pause on a half-typed table name
     (`> cust.id`) posted an invalid buffer; it then became the _baseline_ of the next import,
     the server could not parse it, treated everything as "added by someone else" and
     **restored the old `Ref`** next to the new one. The baseline now only moves when an import
     is acknowledged, and imports are sent one at a time.
  2. **`dbmlSignature` was not canonical for relations.** `a.x < b.y` and inline `[ref: > …]`
     never matched the serializer's `Ref: b.y > a.x`, so every sync replaced the **whole
     buffer** (comments and layout lost). One relation now has one signature (`symbols.ts`).
  3. **Races.** An import answering for an older revision marked a newer buffer clean, and the
     HTTP answer could beat the realtime update (the pre-import project was mirrored back).
     Revision counter + a short grace period; no resync within 1.5 s of a keystroke.
     Also: the resync dispatch maps the cursor through the change and stays out of the undo
     history. **Verified:** `bufferSync.test.ts` (real parse/merge pipeline, two clients),
     `symbols.test.ts`, and `e2e/dbml-editing.e2e.ts` in a real browser — the e2e **fails on the
     previous code** and passes now. **Not done:** when a collaborator's change really differs,
     the buffer is still replaced by the canonical serialisation as a whole (comments lost) — a
     per-block merge would keep untouched tables as written. **Found on the way:** `npm test` in
     `apps/web` ran 5 of 66 tests (unquoted `src/**` glob, no globstar in `sh`) — fixed.
- [x] **DBML editor: make automatic edits explicit and configurable** — done 2026-10-02.
      ⚙ in the editor status bar lists what the editor does on its own (`BehaviourSettings.svelte`,
      `behaviourPrefs.svelte.ts`, per browser): format (never — default / on save), completion
      while typing, bracket closing, sync delay (0.4–2 s or **Ctrl+S only**). Sync indicator in
      `StatusBar.svelte` (`Synchronisé` / `En attente` / `Erreur ligne n`). Verified by the second
      scenario of `e2e/dbml-editing.e2e.ts`. **Left out, deliberately:** "propagated rename
      (ask / always)" — no automatic rename exists to configure (F2 always shows the occurrence
      count and asks); retyping a table name by hand is still a delete + add for the server.
      The settings now use `SegmentedControl` / `Switch` (see below).
- [x] **UI tokens and theme** — done 2026-10-02. `styles/tokens.css` already held colours,
      radii, shadows and z-order for both themes; added what was missing: `--color-locked`
      (+ `-light` / `-border`, both themes), the 4 px spacing scale (`--space-*`, for hand-written
      CSS — Tailwind's spacing utilities are already multiples of 4 px), a type scale
      (`text-caption` 11 … `text-heading` 16), motion (`duration-fast|base|slow`,
      `ease-emphasized`) zeroed under `prefers-reduced-motion`, and `--z-toast`. All bridged in
      `tailwind.config.js`. The catalogue (`/#components`) shows every new component in both
      themes. **Not done:** existing components still use literal sizes (`text-[12.5px]`,
      `duration-150`) — swap them for the tokens screen by screen in Phase 37, not in one sweep.
- [~] **Custom form components** — first slice done 2026-10-02, **decision taken: in-house**,
  no headless dependency (the app already had the hard parts — `actions/portal`,
  `actions/placement`, `hooks/escapeKey`, `hooks/dismissablePopover` — and the plan calls
  them "composants maison"; revisit only if `DataGrid` or a date picker proves too costly).
  In `components/ui/`: `Popover` (anchored, follows scroll / resize; the engine under the
  next two), `Menu` + `MenuItem` (any button as trigger; icon, shortcut hint, checked, danger,
  disabled; arrows / Home / End / type-ahead / Escape), `Select` (icons, hints, groups,
  disabled options, search field past 8 options, type-ahead; ARIA select-only combobox —
  **covers `Combobox`**, there is no free-text variant), `Checkbox` (indeterminate, invalid),
  `RadioGroup`, `Switch`, `SegmentedControl`, `NumberInput` (stepper, unit, bounds on blur),
  `TextArea` (auto-grow), `PasswordInput`, `toast` + `overlays/ToastHost` (action button,
  pauses on hover / focus), `overlays/ConfirmDialog` (three danger levels, "retype the name",
  async-aware). `anchoredPlacement` gained `side: "top"` and `matchWidth`; `Modal` gained
  `narrow`. **Used for real in:** the DBML editor's behaviour settings (`SegmentedControl` +
  `Switch`) and `SettingSwitch`. **Verified:** `e2e/component-catalogue.e2e.ts` drives each
  one by role and from the keyboard in a real browser; `e2e/dbml-editing.e2e.ts` covers the
  migrated settings. **Still to build:**
  - ~~`DataGrid`~~ — built 2026-10-06 (`components/ui/DataGrid.svelte`, logic and 29 unit
    tests in `dataGrid.ts`): rows virtualised (about 20 in the DOM for 10 000), sort by
    header click (numbers by value, NULL last), column resize by drag or keyboard, `role="grid"`
    with row and column indexes. In the catalogue, and behind every SQL result
    (`ResultGrid.svelte` is now a thin wrapper keeping the count line and the CSV export).
    **Not there:** column widths are kept nowhere (lost with the result); sort is per page in
    the explorer; no cell-by-cell keyboard focus; two tab stops per column; columns no longer
    stretch, so a narrow result leaves blank space on the right.
  - ~~`Splitter`~~ — built 2026-10-02 with the SQL drawer (`components/ui/Splitter.svelte`):
    pointer drag, arrow keys / Home / End, a real `separator` for assistive tech. The size is
    the caller's to persist; today that is per browser (`utils/storage`), not per account. The
    DBML panel's own width is still fixed — it could use it.
  - Sub-menus in `Menu`, and moving `ToolbarMenu` / `InsertToolDropdown` /
    `DetailLevelDropdown` / `PluginMenu` / the two context menus onto it — **M**. Its own
    change, with browser coverage of the canvas toolbar checked first.
  - A date picker (nothing uses `<input type="date">` today — build it when something does).
  - `Tooltip`: `GlobalTooltip` (`data-tooltip`) already does the job; what is left is
    replacing the native `title=` attributes still on plain elements. `StatusBar.svelte`'s 8
    were replaced 2026-10-04 (its font-size and problems buttons gained an `aria-label`, which
    the `title` used to stand in for); other files still have some — grep ` title={` under
    `features/`, most hits being a component's own `title` prop.
  - `toast` and `ConfirmDialog` have their first call sites (table locks, the structure
    policy); the last two `window.confirm()` calls went 2026-10-05 (the write-mode SQL run,
    the schema pull from the connection form — the pull's dialog is type-checked, not driven
    by a browser test); `RollbackConfirmModal`, `StatementModal` and `DeleteUserModal` are
    the next candidates.
- [~] **Forbid native controls** — rule in place 2026-10-02 (`eslint.config.js`): raw
  `<select>` and `<input type="checkbox|radio|number">` are an error in
  `apps/web/src/features/**` (`type="date"` is not in the rule yet — no component to point
  to). The files that still use them are listed in `NATIVE_CONTROLS_NOT_MIGRATED` in that
  file — the list only shrinks; migrate screen by screen (Phase 37) and delete the line.
  **7 left** (27 on 2026-10-02, 23 on 2026-10-05): twenty screens were migrated on
  2026-10-05 / 06 (`Select`, `Checkbox`, `Switch`, `RadioGroup`, `NumberInput`) — webhooks,
  connection form and dialog, database users, the deployment dialog and its risk strategies,
  project teams, delete user, errors, invitations, team members, explorer, API key scopes,
  backup codes, convert types, compare projects, import, add index, login. **What is left,
  and why:** `editor/edges/EdgeSettingsPopover` and `editor/nodes/table/FieldEditorPanel` —
  their popover closes on any click outside itself, and `Select` draws its list outside
  (in `document.body`), so picking an option would close the popover: fix
  `useDismissablePopover` or `Select` first; `editor/io/ExportDialog` (driven by
  `plugin-sandbox.e2e.ts` with a native `selectOption` — migrate both together); the four
  `plugins/dialog/*` files. **Covered by a browser test since 2026-10-06:** the connection
  form's fields and the webhook's event checkboxes and switch (`connection-form.e2e.ts`,
  `webhook-options.e2e.ts`). **Still driven by none:** `UsersPanel` (SQLite has no users),
  project teams, delete user, errors filter, invitations, team members, API key scopes,
  backup codes, convert types, the import format, add index, "remember me".
- [x] **Copy / paste tables on the canvas** — done 2026-10-02. `Ctrl/Cmd+C` / `Ctrl/Cmd+V`
      and Copy / Paste in the canvas context menu (`canvas/tableClipboard.ts`,
      `hooks/canvasClipboard.svelte.ts`, `pasteTables` in `projectMutations.ts`). Colours, size,
      detail level, columns, indexes and notes are kept; only the name changes (`_copy`, `_copy2`…
      — `Ctrl+D` now uses the same rule and no longer produces two `x_copy`). Goes through the
      **system clipboard** as DBML + one marker comment line, so it pastes across projects and
      tabs, and as text into the DBML editor. Bound to the `copy` / `paste` DOM events, so it
      works without the async Clipboard API (plain-http self-hosting) and one paste is one undo
      step. **Decisions taken** (the item left them open): a relation between two copied tables
      follows the copies (without its waypoints); a relation to a table that was not copied is
      **dropped**; `Ctrl+V` puts the copies 24 px off the originals (further on each repeat),
      context-menu Paste puts the group at the cursor; comments are not copied. The clipboard
      is untrusted input: rebuilt field by field, capped at 200 tables.
      **Verified:** `tableClipboard.test.ts`, `e2e/canvas-clipboard.e2e.ts` (real browser: copy,
      paste ×3, clipboard text, reload, undo). **Extended 2026-10-05: enums, zones and sticky
      notes** are copied and pasted by the same rules (`CanvasClipboard`: `_copy` names for
      enums, a zone or note keeps its label / text like `Ctrl+D`; the clipboard text holds the
      enums as DBML and each zone / note as a one-line `//` comment; an older clipboard with
      tables only still pastes; the pasted copies are always new, unlocked tables, so no lock is
      touched). Verified: `tableClipboard.test.ts`, second test of `canvas-clipboard.e2e.ts`.
      **Not done:** an enum-typed column pasted into another project keeps the
      type name without the enum (the enum is only copied if it was selected too); plain DBML from elsewhere cannot be pasted onto the canvas
      (needs the parser, i.e. a server round-trip — paste it in the DBML editor); the pasted
      tables are not selected afterwards; context-menu Paste outside a secure context only
      knows this tab's last copy. When Phase 30 lands: a copy of a locked table is not locked
      (nothing to do — locks will be keyed by table name).
- [ ] **Simplify waypoint create/move/delete on a relation line** — **M**. Still the same
      mechanism: `EdgeWaypoints.svelte`/`edgeRouting.svelte.ts` choose select-vs-insert by cursor
      proximity (`candidatePoint`) with only a preview dot as feedback. Needs hands-on iteration on
      the real canvas or the user's steer before redesigning.
- [ ] **Auto-detect a relation pointing the "wrong" way** — **S-M**, needs a decision first.
      No such heuristic exists; a false-positive warning on a legitimate schema is worse than none.

## Phase 30 — Governance: table locks and "structure via the schema" (plan §3, §4)

**Needs first:** the role matrix (Prerequisites). Server is the source of truth for both
features; the UI only mirrors it.

- [x] **Table locks (data model + enforcement)** — done 2026-10-02. Migration 20
      `table_locks`, **keyed by table id** (not name — see the stable-ids prerequisite), with the
      name kept for the audit trail. Routes `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/projects/:id/locks[/:tableId]`
      (`modules/tableLocks/`); audit `table.lock` / `table.unlock`; errors `TABLE_LOCKED`
      (lists the tables), `TABLE_LOCK_FORBIDDEN`, `TABLE_LOCK_INVALID`, `TABLE_NOT_FOUND`, all
      translated. One definition of "touching a locked table" for every write path
      (`findLockViolations`, `packages/shared`): DBML / SQL import, revision and snapshot
      restore, pull from a database, the same under `/api/v1` — **refused whole** — and the
      realtime room, where an update cannot be refused once merged and is instead **put back**
      in a change of its own, with a notice to the connection that sent it.
      **Decisions taken** (the item left them open):
  - _What a lock freezes:_ name, schema, note, columns (name, type, constraints, default,
    note, order), indexes, the foreign keys the table **carries**, and its existence. Not its
    position, size, colour, detail level or comments. A foreign key pointing **at** a locked
    table belongs to the other table and is allowed.
  - _Deletion is frozen at both levels._ The item had deletion under `full` only; a
    "structure" lock that lets the table be dropped and recreated protects nothing. So
    `structure` and `full` are **enforced alike today**; `full` is stored and will add the
    table's seed in Phase 33.
  - _Who:_ permission `table.lock.manage` = project `administrator`. They may also still
    edit a table under a project lock.
  - _Instance locks:_ each lock has an authority, `project` or `instance`. Only an instance
    administrator can place an `instance` lock, and then only instance administrators can
    edit the table or lift it — the "can a project admin lift an instance-admin lock"
    question, answered no, but as a choice made per lock rather than by who happened to
    place it.
  - _Table-only._ Per-column locks wait for a column identity (see prerequisites).

  **Verified:** `tableLocks.test.ts` (shared), `realtime/room.test.ts` (revert, move kept,
  per-connection, lift on revalidate), `modules/tableLocks/routes.test.ts` (rights, import
  refused whole, an unchanged locked table survives the DBML round trip, restore, pull,
  cascade on project delete). **Found on the way, fixed:** pulling a schema from a database
  left every relation pointing at ids no table had (`connections/pull.ts` gave tables fresh
  ids and kept the relations on the introspection's) — relations now follow their tables.
  **Lock management under `/api/v1`** — added 2026-10-04: `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/locks`,
  `PUT` / `DELETE …/locks/:table` (`publicApi/lockRoutes.ts`), the table named by id **or by
  name**, behind `projects:read` / `projects:write`; the rules themselves moved to
  `tableLocks/service.ts`, shared with the app's routes. Verified in `tableLocks/routes.test.ts`
  (API keys, scopes, by name and by id, an instance lock out of reach).
  **Not done:** plugins need nothing special (they write through the realtime doc) but no plugin was
  tested; the revert is a second revision in the history and briefly visible to other
  clients — merging it into the offending update before broadcast would hide both; the
  security review the Phase 27 rule asks for.

- [~] **Table locks (editor UI)** — first slice done 2026-10-02. Padlock in the table header
  (visible at rest, tooltip with level, who, why); dashed border; for someone the lock
  binds, no rename (header and settings popover), no add / edit / reorder / delete column, no
  index edit — colour, comments and duplicate stay; Delete leaves the table in place and
  says why (also when deleting another table would strip a locked table's foreign key);
  lock dialog for administrators (`locks/TableLockDialog.svelte`: level, authority for
  instance administrators, reason, unlock) built on the Phase 29 components; lock changes
  reach collaborators live (`ServerNotice` on the project socket); a refused DBML sync is
  shown in the panel instead of only logged. **Verified:** `e2e/table-locks.e2e.ts`, two
  browser sessions. **Still to do:**
  - ~~Read-only range for a locked table in the DBML editor~~ — built 2026-10-04
    (`dbml/lockedRanges.ts`): the `Table … { … }` block of a table whose lock binds the user is
    tinted and refuses edits (a CodeMirror `changeFilter`), with a toast naming the table;
    resyncs from the document and **Formater** (whitespace only) pass. Covered by
    `e2e/table-locks.e2e.ts`. Not frozen: a standalone `Ref:` line carried by a locked table,
    and an inline `[ref: …]` elsewhere pointing at it — the server still decides those.
  - ~~The "Verrous" list~~ — built 2026-10-04 (`locks/TableLocksList.svelte`): a padlock with
    the count in the workspace bar, shown as soon as one table is locked, opens every lock of
    the project (level, authority, who, when, why). Read by anyone who sees the project;
    "Modifier" / "Déverrouiller" for those who may manage that lock; a lock whose table was
    deleted is listed as such and can still be lifted. Covered by `e2e/table-locks.e2e.ts`
    (editor reads, administrator lifts, the button goes away live). Not there: placing a lock
    from the list (it lists locks, not tables), and no entry point while nothing is locked.
  - Context-menu entries (lock; rename / delete shown disabled with the reason) — the
    padlock button covers the action, the menu does not mention locks yet.
  - ~~Editing or deleting a relation carried by a locked table is still offered~~ — closed
    2026-10-04 on the canvas: such a relation has no cardinality / action / reverse / delete in
    its popover and context menu (colour and routing stay), `Delete` leaves it, and a relation
    cannot be drawn onto a locked table's column — each with a toast naming the table
    (`projectMutations.test.ts`). Still offered and then put back by the server: bulk actions
    (type conversion, canvas plugins).
  - ~~MCD view shows no padlock~~ — done 2026-10-04: `locks/LockBadge.svelte` on the entity
    (and on the association a locked junction table became), dashed border, same tooltip as
    the table node. Read-only there, like the rest of that view. Covered by
    `e2e/table-locks.e2e.ts`.

- [x] **Structure policy per connection** — done 2026-10-02. Three policies (`schema-only`,
      `warn`, `free`) plus "also apply to free SQL"; an **instance default** (new
      `instance_settings` table, edited at the top of Admin → Connexions — there is no
      Admin → Paramètres screen yet) and a **per-connection override** in
      `ConnectionEditModal.svelte` (migration 21: `db_connections.structure_policy`,
      `structure_policy_sql`). Changes audited (`dbconn.policy`, `instance.structure_policy`);
      a project route cannot set it. **Decisions taken:**
  - _Per connection + instance default_, not per project. A connection's own policy simply
    wins, stricter or looser: only instance administrators reach the console, so "never
    looser unless the instance admin decides" had no one left to restrict.
  - _Only for a database a project models._ A connection attached to no project is left
    alone whatever the policy — there is no schema to go through. (The plan had it offer
    "create a project from this database"; refusing to drop a table on a scratch database
    until a project exists seemed worse than not interfering. Not built.)
  - _Only what a project models:_ tables (so columns and constraints) and indexes. Views,
    functions, triggers and whole databases are not intercepted — the schema editor cannot
    own them, so there would be nowhere to send the user.
  - _`read-only` stays separate:_ it refuses every write, data included; the policy only
    concerns structure.
  - **Default is `schema-only`, and it applies on upgrade:** an instance that upgrades finds
    table DDL refused in the console for connections attached to a project, until an
    administrator relaxes the default. Deliberate (it is the point of the feature), and the
    first line of the changelog entry.
- [x] **Intercept structural actions in the console** — done 2026-10-02.
      `sqlGuard.ts#findStructuralStatements` finds `CREATE / ALTER / DROP TABLE|INDEX` and
      MySQL's `RENAME TABLE` (temporary tables, permission grants and unmodelled objects
      excluded; a SQL Server batch is scanned whole). `schema-only`: the explorer's drop table /
      drop column and write-mode SQL answer `409 STRUCTURE_VIA_SCHEMA` with what was attempted
      and the projects concerned, and the console shows "Modifier la structure" with **Ouvrir
      dans le schéma ➜** — a plain link, `/project/:id?table=…&field=…`, which opens the
      project with the table (and column) selected. `warn`: SQL answers
      `STRUCTURE_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`, runs once confirmed (`ConfirmDialog`, its first real
      use), and is audited `dbadmin.structure.out_of_schema`; in the explorer, typing the
      object's name is that confirmation. **Verified:** `sqlGuard.test.ts`,
      `dbAdmin/routes.test.ts` (4 scenarios), `e2e/structure-policy.e2e.ts`. **Not done:** like
      the read-only check it is a guard rail, not a parser — DDL built inside a procedure, a
      `DO` block or `EXEC('…')` is not seen; a quoted object name is reported without its name
      (the redirect then opens the project without selecting a table); ~~the write-mode run is
      still confirmed by a native `confirm()`~~ (`ConfirmDialog` since 2026-10-05; it does not
      ask for the connection's name on the production stage yet); the security review the
      Phase 27 rule asks for.

- [x] **Drift banner after an out-of-schema action** — done 2026-10-02. A structural change
      made from the console on a database a project models (policy `warn` or `free`, SQL or
      explorer) marks every project linked to it (`project_connection_links.out_of_schema_at`,
      migration 22). The editor shows "La base « X » a été modifiée en dehors du schéma", live
      (`ServerNotice` `drift-changed`), to everyone who can open the project; project
      administrators also get the number of differences and three actions — **Voir les
      différences** (the existing read-only deployment plan), **Resynchroniser** (pull, after
      confirmation) and **Ignorer**. A **reference fingerprint** (`schema_fingerprints`) is
      recorded after every successful deployment, rollback and pull, and
      `POST …/connections/:connId/drift-check` reads the database and answers both "how does it
      differ from the schema" and "what changed since the reference". A deployment or a pull
      clears the mark. **Verified:** `dbAdmin/routes.test.ts` (the whole cycle),
      `e2e/structure-policy.e2e.ts`. **Not done — this is the banner, not detection:** nothing
      looks at the database on its own, so a change made by another tool is only found when
      someone runs the check or opens the deployment plan. Periodic detection, attribution,
      per-line import / revert / ignore and the alert centre are Phase 34, which now has its
      reference fingerprint and its storage to build on (it still needs the job runner).

## Phase 31 — Workspace, SQL in the editor, history (plan §0, §6, §19)

- [~] **Workspace shell with tabs** — first slice done 2026-10-02. A bar of tabs under the
  project header (`features/workspace/WorkspaceBar.svelte`): **Schéma** (the editor),
  **Données & SQL** (the database console — explorer, SQL, and where the engine has them
  accounts and sessions — on the project's connection), **Déploiements** (history,
  rollback, "check differences", deploy) and **Historique** (the revision timeline, now a
  page instead of a dialog). Each tab is an address — `/project/:id/data`, `/deployments`,
  `/history` — so reload, links and back / forward work. One **connection selector** for the
  whole workspace, with the environment next to it (red when the label looks like
  production — a guess on a free-text label until Phase 32's stages). When the console is
  used from the project, the Phase 30 redirect is a tab change with the table selected.
  **Decisions taken:**
  - _`/project/:id/:tab`, not `/projects/:id/:tab`_: existing links and bookmarks keep working.
  - _The shell lives in `ProjectEditor.svelte`_, not in a separate `WorkspaceShell`: the
    document connection, presence and the header have to outlive a tab change, and they
    already live there. The file has grown and wants splitting (see the watchlist).
  - _The other tabs replace the editor, they do not cover it_: an unmounted canvas has no
    shortcuts or clipboard handlers to fire by accident. The price: the canvas selection is
    lost on a round trip (viewport and document are not).
  - _Who sees what follows the server_: Données & SQL for instance administrators and, since
    2026-10-06, for members granted one of the project's databases (explorer and SQL only),
    Déploiements for project administrators, Historique for everyone (label / restore need
    `edit`). A tab named by the URL but not offered falls back to Schéma.

  **Verified:** `e2e/workspace.e2e.ts`. **Still to do:**
  - Collaborators and Deploy are still in the header, not in the workspace bar: the plan's
    single bar (project · environment · connection · people · Deploy) is not merged.
  - No top-level "Utilisateurs" / "Sessions" tabs: they are sections of Données & SQL, as
    in the console.
  - Tab visibility for a non-administrator is not covered by a browser test.
  - The Pipeline and Sauvegardes tabs (Phase 32) will be added here.

- [x] **Extract shared SQL components** — done 2026-10-02. `SqlPanel.svelte` (with its
      history list), `ResultGrid.svelte`, `format.ts` and `StructureRedirectDialog.svelte` moved
      from `features/admin/connections/` to `features/sql/`; `services/dbAdminApi.ts` unchanged.
      `SqlPanel` lost its native `<select>` and checkbox on the way (`Select`, `Switch`).
      `ResultGrid` is still the plain table — replacing it by a virtualised `DataGrid` is the
      Phase 29 item.
- [~] **SQL panel in the schema editor** — first slice done 2026-10-02. A drawer under the
  diagram (`features/sql/EditorSqlDrawer.svelte`): toggle button in the workspace bar and
  `Ctrl+J` (also while typing), resizable with the new `Splitter`, open / closed and height
  remembered per browser; it is the console's own `SqlPanel` on the workspace's current
  connection, so read-only by default, history, CSV, audit and the Phase 30 interception all
  come with it. **Voir les données** — a button in each table's header — opens the drawer
  and runs the engine's own "first 100 rows" (`previewStatement.ts`: `LIMIT`, `TOP`,
  `FETCH FIRST`; identifiers quoted only when they have to be). **Verified:**
  `previewStatement.test.ts`, `e2e/workspace.e2e.ts`. **Still to do:**
  - ~~The permission decision~~ — done 2026-10-06, as the owner asked: **database access
    granted by an instance administrator** (migration 36 `db_access_grants`, module
    `modules/dbAccess/`), per user or per team (members inherit), `read` or `write`, on one
    connection. `read`: explorer + read-only SQL (driver READ ONLY transaction, plus the
    read-only screening before the driver, 1 000 rows / 30 s, `connectionBudget`); `write`:
    also one data statement at a time (`sqlGuard.ts#assertDataStatement`), with
    `confirmWrite` required by the server; structure never, whatever the structure policy;
    drops, accounts, sessions, backups stay `requireAdmin`. The explorer and SQL routes are
    registered a second time under `/api/connections/:id/…` behind `requireDbConsoleUser`
    (admins unchanged there); the grant is read on every request, so revocation is immediate.
    Every member query, refused ones included, is audited `dbaccess.query`. Personal mode:
    the member's own account, `PERSONAL_CREDENTIALS_REQUIRED` without one. Granting: Admin →
    Utilisateurs (`UserDbAccessModal`), Admin → Équipes (team detail), Admin → Invitations
    (teams + databases + proposed SQL account name, applied in the acceptance transaction).
    The proposed name pre-fills "Mon compte SQL" (`suggestedUsername`, app route only — not in
    `/api/v1`). **Verified:** `dbAccess/routes.test.ts` (7 scenarios: not granted, read cannot
    write, write confirmed and never structure, team inherited and revoked, cascades, personal
    mode, invitation applied on acceptance, connection account protected), `sqlGuard.test.ts`,
    `migrations.test.ts`, `e2e/db-access.e2e.ts` (admin grants in the UI, member reads, a
    `DELETE` refused). Also run once by hand (a throwaway script, not in the suite) against
    the local PostgreSQL 55432 and MySQL 53306 test containers, shared account: before grant
    404, read select / write refused, write insert / update ok, `DROP` / `TRUNCATE` refused,
    connection account protected. **Not verified:** a member on a personal-account connection
    with a real login; SQL Server and Oracle; the write path in a browser; the team and
    invitation screens were type-checked, not clicked. **Not done:** no page outside
    a project, so a grant on a connection attached to no project the member can open has no
    entry point in the UI; no API-key access; the independent security review.
  - "Voir les données" is a header button, not a context-menu entry (tables have no context
    menu yet — see the `Menu` migration in Phase 29).
  - Clicking a table name in a result to select it in the graph; following a foreign key
    from a result row.
  - A **CodeMirror SQL editor** with completion fed by the project schema — the editor is
    still a `<textarea>` (also an open item of the console follow-ups, Phase 27).
  - ~~The write-mode run is still confirmed by a native `confirm()`~~ — `ConfirmDialog` since
    2026-10-05.
- [~] **Undo / redo and visual history** — first slice done 2026-10-03.
  - _Per-user undo_ was already there: `Y.UndoManager` only tracks local origins, remote
    updates carry `yjsClient`'s remote origin. Now **capped at 200 steps** per session
    (`projectDoc.svelte.ts`). A restore is a new revision (unchanged), refused on a locked
    table (unchanged — now also for a partial restore).
  - _Timeline_ (`history/timeline.ts`, `HistoryPanel.svelte`): newest first; each revision
    carries a short summary of the tables it touched (`RevisionMeta.changes`, computed in
    `listMeaningfulRevisions`); **micro-edits grouped** client-side — same author, ≤ 2 min
    apart, ≤ 15 min per line, a label or a marker ends the line — expandable into steps, so
    every revision stays restorable; "Mes modifications" filter (on the display name
    revisions are recorded under).
  - _Markers_ (`GET /api/projects/:id/history/markers`, `projects/historyMarkers.ts`): lock
    placed / lifted and restores from the audit log (`view`), deployments and rollbacks
    from `deployment_history` (project administrators only — the deployment-history rule).
    A restore's audit line now names the revision it wrote, so the marker sits exactly
    before it even within one second.
  - _Preview on the graph_: "Aperçu sur le graphe" switches to the schema tab with the tables
    added / changed since the revision outlined green / orange (a node `class`, memoised so
    the node cache keeps working) and a strip (`HistoryPreviewBanner.svelte`) naming the
    tables deleted since; live against the current schema.
  - _Partial restore_: `restoreTables` (`dbml-engine/partialRestore.ts`) + optional
    `tableIds` on the restore route. **Decision:** a foreign key follows the table that
    carries it (the lock rule) — restored tables get their own FKs back, other tables keep
    theirs unless the target disappeared.
  - **Found on the way, fixed:** the history showed SQLite's UTC times as local time.

  **Verified:** `partialRestore.test.ts`, `timeline.test.ts`, `projects/routes.test.ts`
  (partial restore, invalid body, markers per role), `e2e/history.e2e.ts` (grouping, steps,
  preview classes on the canvas, bringing a deleted table back, the marker's place).
  **Still to do:**
  - Removed tables are named in the strip, not drawn as ghosts on the canvas; the preview is
    table-level (no per-column colouring); relations are counted, not drawn.
  - Markers for published versions (Phase 35) and drift (needs Phase 34's journal — today
    only the _current_ out-of-schema mark is stored, not its history).
  - Column-level partial restore (needs the column identity of the prerequisites); enums and
    zones are not part of a partial restore.
  - Restoring an unlabelled point inside a group means expanding it first — fine for now,
    revisit if people miss it.
  - **Open (unchanged):** retention / compaction of detailed revisions; whether undoing a
    deployed change proposes a new deployment.

## Phase 32 — Environments, backups and safe deployment (plan §11, §12, §13)

Builds on Phase 27's deployment machinery (`modules/connections/deploy.ts`,
`deploymentHistory.ts`, `DeploymentModal.svelte`). **Phase 27's rule applies to every item
here: each gets its own security review before it is closed.**

- [~] **Configurable environment pipeline** — first slice done 2026-10-03. Migration 23:
  `environments(id, name, color, protection, is_production, position)` (unique name, a partial
  unique index keeps **at most one** production stage) and `db_connections.environment_id`;
  every label in use became a stage (see the changelog for the guess). `modules/environments/`:
  `GET /api/environments` (anyone signed in), `POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/admin/environments` and
  `PUT …/order` (instance administrators, audited `environment.*`). Admin → Environnements
  (`EnvironmentsTab.svelte`): chain preview, rename, colour, protection, production, reorder
  (arrows), delete. Connections pick a stage (`Select` in `ConnectionFormFields`);
  `EnvironmentBadge` replaces the "looks like production" guess everywhere (workspace bar, SQL
  drawer, deployments tab, admin list, console). **Production enforced server-side**: deploy and
  rollback — app and `/api/v1` — need `confirmName` equal to the connection's name
  (`assertProductionConfirmed`, `deploy.ts`); the app asks with `ConfirmDialog` /
  `RollbackConfirmModal`.
  **Decisions taken:**
  - _`db_connections.environment` stays_, as the stage's name kept in step on rename (one
    `UPDATE` in the same transaction): deployment history, webhooks and drift read it as a
    snapshot and needed no change. `environment_id` is the reference.
  - _At most one production stage, not exactly one_: an instance may have none (a warning says
    so); flagging another moves the flag.
  - _A free-text name sent by an older client resolves to an existing stage or is refused_
    (`ENVIRONMENT_NOT_FOUND`, listing the known names) — inventing stages from whatever was
    typed would undo the administrator's chain.
  - _A project administrator may still choose a connection's stage_ (including off production);
    they could deploy anyway by typing the name, so this is no escalation.

  **Verified:** `migrations.test.ts` (label mapping, seeding), `environments/routes.test.ts`
  (rights, uniqueness, reorder, single production, rename carried to connections, delete,
  production deploy + rollback refused without the name), `e2e/environments.e2e.ts`.
  **Still to do:**
  - Per-project override of the chain (`project_environments`) — not built.
  - _Protection_: anything but `free` now enforces the stage order (the pipeline item below);
    approval and windows are still to do.
  - Write-mode SQL and explorer drops in the console on a production connection do not ask for
    the name (the console has its own confirmations; align them).
  - Drag-and-drop reordering (arrows today); the security review of the Phase 27 rule.

- [~] **Pipeline and promotion** — first slice done 2026-10-04: **no stage skipping**.
  Migration 33 `deployment_history.schema_hash`: every deployment records which schema it
  deployed (the strict fingerprint of the project as written, placeholders included, so one
  schema has one hash on every stage). `modules/pipeline/`: `projectPipeline` lays the
  project's databases along the chain — per database the last deployment and whether it is
  **level** (the last thing done there is a successful deployment of the current schema, not
  rolled back) — and `assertStageOrder`, called by `deployToConnection` before any connection
  is opened: a stage whose **protection is not `free`** takes a schema only once the nearest
  earlier stage _on which the project has a database_ is level (`409 PIPELINE_STAGE_SKIPPED`,
  naming both stages). This is the first thing `protection` enforces. The way past:
  `skipStageOrder: true` + `skipReason` — **instance administrators only**, audited
  `connection.deploy.stage_skipped` — on the app's route and `/api/v1`.
  `GET /api/projects/:id/pipeline` (and `/api/v1/projects/:id/pipeline`, 2026-10-04). UI: the "Pipeline" card at the top of the Déploiements tab
  (`workspace/PipelineCard.svelte`: stages, state per database — à niveau / en retard / échec /
  jamais déployé —, "Attend X", Deploy per database), and in the deployment dialog the refusal
  in the reader's language with, for an instance administrator, a reason field and "Sauter
  l'étape et déployer". **Decisions taken:**
  - _A card, not a tab_: it is three boxes and belongs next to the history; a tab when
    approvals and windows give it more to show.
  - _"Promote" is "deploy the same schema to the next stage"_: the diff is always the target's
    own (introspection), which the deployment already did. No separate promote action.
  - _Stages the project has no database on are not part of its pipeline_; a database on no
    stage is outside it and deployed freely.
  - _Level is about the schema's structure_: a seed or a note changed since does not put a
    stage behind.
  - **Applies on upgrade**: entries from before have no hash, so every stage reads "behind"
    until deployed to once; a production deployment of a project that also has an earlier
    stage is refused until that stage has the schema. First line of the changelog entry.

  **Verified:** `pipeline/routes.test.ts` (order, refusal, level after each deployment, behind
  after a schema change, skip: rights, reason, audit; unstaged database), `openapi.test.ts`,
  `e2e/pipeline.e2e.ts` (the card, a refused deployment, in-order deployments, the skip).
  **Found on the way, fixed:** the deployment dialog showed the server's English message for
  every refused deployment; it now goes through the translated error catalogue.
  **Still to do:** versions (`vN` — needs Phase 35's published versions; today "the current
  schema"); required approval for `review` (it is enforced like `protected` for now);
  deployment windows / freeze; "mandatory backup" per stage (production only today); a
  per-project chain; alerts on promotion; a rollback on stage N does not flag N+1 as ahead;
  ~~the card does not refresh by itself when the schema changes~~ (done 2026-10-04: the editor
  hands the card the schema's fingerprint, computed in the browser; when it differs from the
  one the server answered with, the card asks again — once per schema, after 0.8 s; a
  deployment made from another browser still needs "Actualiser"); the security review of the
  Phase 27 rule.

- [~] **Compare environments** — first slice done 2026-10-04. `compareSchemas` +
  `describeTableChange` (`dbml-engine/schemaHash.ts`): two structures by the **strict**
  fingerprint, tables only in one side, tables that differ with the detail (columns only on one
  side, a column's type / nullability / default before → after, key, indexes, foreign keys),
  and whether the project's schema has the table at all. `POST
/api/projects/:id/connections/compare` `{ sourceId, targetId }` (`connections/compare.ts`,
  project administrators, the two databases read one after the other). UI: the "Comparer deux
  environnements" card on the Déploiements tab when the project has two databases or more
  (`CompareEnvironmentsCard.svelte`), with "Hors schéma" on what nobody modelled.
  **Verified:** `schemaHash.test.ts`, `connections/compare.test.ts` (two SQLite files, rights,
  identical once level), `e2e/compare-environments.e2e.ts`. **Still to do:** per-line
  "Promouvoir" (needs the pipeline item above — today the way to level two stages is to deploy
  the schema to each); two engines compare by canonical type names, which is only as good as
  `TYPE_ALIASES` (not tried across engines); index and foreign-key differences are flagged,
  not itemised; `connectionBudget` is not consulted (`/api/v1` added 2026-10-04); views and other objects are
  outside the fingerprint.
- [~] **Per-environment variables** — first slice done 2026-10-04. A table's **name** or
  **schema** may hold `{{variable}}` placeholders (`Table "{{table_prefix}}orders"`,
  `Table "{{schema}}".users`); each stage gives them values (migration 32
  `environments.variables_json`, typed in Admin → Environnements as `name=value, …`).
  `dbml-engine/variables.ts` (`variablesUsed`, `resolveVariables`, `parseVariableValues`);
  server `environments/variables.ts#schemaForConnection`, called wherever the schema meets a
  database: the deployment plan, the deployment itself (DDL **and** seeds — same table ids),
  the drift check, the environment comparison's "hors schéma", and the pull, which finds a
  templated table under the stage's name and **keeps its placeholders**.
  **Refused before any connection is opened** (`409 VARIABLES_UNRESOLVED`, with the names): a
  variable the stage does not define, a table left without a name, two tables resolving to one
  name. **Decisions taken:**
  - _Names and schemas only._ Not column names, types or defaults: a column that changes name
    per stage is another schema, not a variable; `{{tablespace}}` waits for the DDL generator
    to know tablespaces at all.
  - _Values are identifier fragments_ (letters, digits, `_ $ . -`, 64 at most; empty allowed):
    checked when saved, so nothing a stage holds can carry SQL into a statement.
  - _A connection without a stage has no variables_: a schema with placeholders cannot be
    deployed to it. The linter's naming rule ignores placeholders.
  - _The project keeps the placeholders_ everywhere else: canvas, DBML, exports, history.

  **Verified:** `variables.test.ts`, `environments/routes.test.ts` (SQLite: plan, deployment,
  seed into the prefixed table, no drift afterwards, refusal, empty value, pull),
  `e2e/variables.e2e.ts`. **Found on the way, fixed:** a DBML text with tables in **several
  schemas** lost every table but the first schema's on import (`toProject` read
  `schemas[0]`), and a relation between tables of a named schema was written without the
  schema, which made the whole text unparseable — both in `dbml-engine`, with a regression
  test. **Still to do:** per-project and per-connection overrides (two projects on one stage
  share its values today); encrypted secret variables; the editor does not list the variables
  a schema uses nor preview a stage's names; `{{tablespace}}`; rollback SQL is stored
  resolved (fine) but the "check differences" dialog shows resolved names without saying so;
  not tried on a schema-capable engine (`{{schema}}` on PostgreSQL / SQL Server — SQLite has
  no schemas); the security review of the Phase 27 rule.

- [~] **Destructive-change detection in the deployment plan** — first slice done 2026-10-03.
  One engine-agnostic analysis replaces the five `inspectRisks` (which disagreed — SQL Server
  and Oracle only checked dropped tables — and read sample rows): `planRiskProbes`
  (`dbml-engine/deploymentProbes.ts`, pure, one **aggregate** query per risky change, in the
  target's dialect) + `analyzeDeploymentRisks` (`connections/riskAnalysis.ts`, runs them
  through the drivers' new `queryScalar`, 5 s per probe, 20 s in all, a failed probe reported
  _unmeasured_). Covered: dropped table / column with data, type change, NOT NULL over NULLs,
  new NOT NULL column without default on a non-empty table, text limit below the longest
  value (an `info` line when it fits), new unique / PK over duplicates, new FK over orphans.
  **Enforced server-side at apply** (`settleRisks`, measured again, never trusted from the
  client): a risk answered — or defaulting to — "cancel" refuses the deployment; on the
  production stage every critical risk needs an explicit answer. Settled risks + an optional
  reason go to `deployment_history.accepted_risks` / `risk_note` (migration 24) and show in
  the history. The SQL preview is now regenerated client-side from the answers.
  **Found on the way, fixed:** "Annuler / Gérer manuellement" was offered and ignored — the
  destructive change ran; `typesMatch` treated `varchar(320)` and `varchar(255)` as one type,
  so a size change was never deployed. New strategy `PROCEED` for an unmeasured constraint.
  **Verified:** `deploymentProbes.test.ts`, `riskAnalysis.test.ts` (SQLite, through the
  routes), the driver tests, `e2e/deployment-risks.e2e.ts`.
  **Still to do:**
  - Precision / scale reduction on numerics, and "incompatible type change" beyond a count
    (e.g. text → int over non-numeric values) — not probed.
  - Rename seen as drop + add (needs column identity, see prerequisites).
  - "Save the column before" (needs backups); per-stage blocking beyond production (needs the
    pipeline's stage guards); `connectionBudget` is not consulted (time bounds only).
  - The probes run on the target with the deploying user's connection: on a very large table a
    `COUNT(*)` may be slow until its 5 s cut-off.
- [ ] **Deployment rollback with inverse script** — **L**. Button "Revenir avant ce
      déploiement" in the history: inverse script computed from the **before/after fingerprints**
      (not guessed), data-loss list, option to back the data up first, schema rolled back as a new
      revision, irreversible cases flagged. Today's `rollbackGenerator.ts` is the starting point —
      check how it relates before building. **Blocked by:** fingerprint; backups.
- [~] **Logical backups** — first slice done 2026-10-03. `modules/backups/`: a backup reads the
  structure (introspection) then every table page by page through the driver's new `queryRows`
  (all five engines; ordered by primary key, 2 000 rows a page) and writes one JSON document per
  line → gzip → **AES-256-GCM** → one file, never whole in memory (`storage.ts`). Each file has
  its own random key; the instance secret encrypts that key in the `backups` row (migration 29),
  so `rotate-secret` re-encrypts keys, not files. SHA-256 of the stored file, checked before
  every download and restore. Tables are stored **parents first** (the order a restore inserts
  in). Runs in the background: `POST /api/admin/connections/:id/backups` answers `202`, the
  list shows tables done / total, `…/cancel` stops it between pages, one backup per database at
  a time, a backup cut by a restart is marked failed at boot. Size ceiling
  `NEBULADB_DATABASE_BACKUP_MAX_MB` (512, before compression — over it the backup **fails**
  and says to use the engine's tool), retention `NEBULADB_DATABASE_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`
  (30; hourly sweep on the scheduler; a **pinned** backup is never swept), directory
  `NEBULADB_DATABASE_BACKUP_DIR` (next to the app database). Download = the decrypted file,
  still gzipped (`.jsonl.gz`). A deleted connection takes its backups with it. Audited
  (`backup.create|download|delete|restore`). UI: the **Sauvegardes** tab of the database console
  (`features/backups/BackupsPanel.svelte`) — so also in the workspace's Données & SQL tab.
  **Before a deployment:** `deployToConnection` backs the database up first when the connection
  is on the production stage (or when `backupBefore: true`), only if the deployment changes
  something; a backup that does not complete **refuses the deployment** (`BACKUP_FAILED`);
  `backupBefore: false` is the explicit way without. The backup's id is kept in
  `deployment_history.backup_id` and shown in the history.
  **Decisions taken:**
  - _Instance administrators only_, like the console: a backup is every row of the database. A
    project administrator can _cause_ one (the pre-deployment copy) but not list, download or
    restore it.
  - _JSON Lines, not SQL / CSV per table_: one streamable file, `NULL` and the empty string
    told apart, bytes as base64 — and nothing to quote per dialect.
  - _Not a consistent snapshot_: tables are read one after another, without a transaction
    across them. Fine for a quiet database, approximate under writes — said in the user guide.
  - _The existing `NEBULADB_BACKUP_*` variables stay what they were_ (the app's own data);
    the new ones are `NEBULADB_DATABASE_BACKUP_*`.

  **Verified:** `backups/routes.test.ts` on SQLite (rights; a backup with a 64-bit integer, a
  blob, `NULL` vs empty string and a multi-line text restored bit for bit; the file is neither
  readable nor a plain gzip; altered file refused; size ceiling; pin / retention; restart;
  connection delete; the production deployment with, without, and refused), the SQLite driver
  test, `e2e/backups.e2e.ts`. **PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server and Oracle: `queryRows` and the
  page query are written and unit-tested as text, but were not run against a live server**
  (no Docker on the machine that day) — run `drivers/live.test.ts`-style checks before relying
  on them; dates on SQL Server / Oracle go through JavaScript dates (UTC, milliseconds).
  **Schedules** (added 2026-10-03, second slice): one per connection (migration 30
  `backup_schedules`, `modules/backups/schedule.ts`, `PUT …/connections/:id/backup-schedule`,
  `BackupScheduleCard.svelte`) — daily, weekly (weekday) or monthly (day 1–28) at an hour of the
  **server's local time**, keeping the last N scheduled backups (pinned ones neither count nor
  go; the age-based sweep leaves scheduled backups alone). A one-minute job on the scheduler runs
  what is due, one database after the other; saving a schedule never fires it for an hour
  already past; a server that was down runs **one** catch-up backup, not one per missed
  occurrence; the run is recorded before it starts, so a crash does not loop. Verified:
  `shared/backups.test.ts` (occurrences), `backups/routes.test.ts` (fires once, catch-up, keep,
  pin, off; **cancel** now covered too), `e2e/backups.e2e.ts`. Not done for schedules: the plan's
  three-tier retention (7 daily / 4 weekly / 6 monthly — one frequency and one count today), a
  per-table scope, a time zone other than the server's, an alert when a scheduled backup fails
  (the card says so; nothing is sent — Phase 34's channels).
  **Still to do:** destinations other than the local directory (S3-compatible, SFTP —
  `storage_targets`); the weekly **restore test** into a scratch database; ~~a per-table choice in
  the UI~~ (done 2026-10-04: "Choisir les tables…" — `BackupScopeDialog.svelte`, tables only,
  with a note); `connectionBudget` is spent once per backup, not per page,
  and there is no per-page time limit; views, sequences and accounts are not in a backup;
  paging by `OFFSET` gets slow on very large tables (keyset on the primary key would not);
  ~~`/api/v1`~~ (done 2026-10-05: `GET` / `POST /api/v1/connections/:id/backups`,
  `GET` / `DELETE /api/v1/backups/:id`, `POST …/cancel`, `GET …/download` —
  `publicApi/backupRoutes.ts`, instance administrators, scope `connections:manage`, a
  project-restricted key refused; the rules moved to `backups/service.ts`, shared with the
  app's routes. **Restore, the schedule and the pin are left to the app** on purpose — a
  restore empties tables and asks for the target's name to be retyped); the security review of the Phase 27 rule. Open (unchanged): who pays for
  storage, legal retention of backups holding personal data.

- [~] **Restore** — first slice done 2026-10-03 (`modules/backups/restore.ts`,
  `POST /api/admin/backups/:id/restore`, `RestoreDialog.svelte`). **Data only**: the chosen
  tables are emptied (children first) and refilled from the backup (parents first, 500 rows a
  batch, bound parameters), into the backup's own connection or another one **of the same
  engine**. Refused before anything is touched: no `confirmName` equal to the target's name
  (every target, not only production); a `read-only` target; a table or column of the backup
  missing in the target; a table outside the selection that references one inside it (emptying
  would fail on its foreign key — or cascade into it); a cycle among the chosen tables; a file
  that no longer matches its checksum. A **safety backup** of the target's current rows is taken
  first (`pre-restore`, listed like any other) unless `skipSafetyBackup` is sent. The result is
  per table (deleted / inserted / error). **Verified:** `backups/routes.test.ts`,
  `e2e/backups.e2e.ts`. **Still to do:**
  - **Not atomic across tables**: a failure half-way leaves the tables after it empty — the
    safety backup is what brings the previous state back. One transaction for the whole restore
    needs the drivers to expose one.
  - No preview of what will be lost ("21 rows created since"); no restore into a **new**
    database or of the **structure** (deploy first); no cross-engine restore.
  - `GENERATED ALWAYS` columns and sequences (PostgreSQL `serial` is not moved past the
    restored ids) — not handled. SQL Server identity columns are: `MssqlDriver.insertRows`
    sets `IDENTITY_INSERT` when the rows carry the identity column (`drivers/mssql.test.ts`,
    live, needs `docker-compose.mssql.yml`).
  - A self-referencing table is inserted in primary-key order, which may not satisfy its own
    foreign key.
  - Table locks are not consulted (they freeze the schema and the seed, not rows — decide);
    a dedicated right `backup.restore` (today: instance administrator); double approval on
    production; the security review of the Phase 27 rule.
- [ ] **Native backups and point-in-time (later)** — **XL**. Engine tools (`pg_dump`,
      `mysqldump`, `BACKUP DATABASE`, Data Pump) — needs the client tools in the image; archived
      logs (WAL, binlog) for point-in-time when the DBA configured them. This is the "backup/
      restore and data import" item of the console follow-ups (Phase 27).
- [ ] **Fine data rollback and unified timeline** — **L**. Restore a row range ("lines deleted
      between X and Y"); "Annuler cette requête" for small writes made from Nebula (keep the
      before-image under a row threshold); one timeline of deployments, backups, restores and
      external drifts with a return point at each step.
- [ ] **Deployment safety extras** — **S each**, unarbitrated: pre-deploy impact analysis
      (relations / views / indexes / seeds touched, lock-time estimate), deployment windows and
      one-click freeze, review-before-deploy (1–2 approvers) — see Phase 38.

## Phase 33 — Data: seeds and test data (plan §5, §14)

- [~] **CSV seeds for tables** — first slice done 2026-10-03. `packages/shared/src/seeds.ts`
  (pure, shared by the editor preview and the server): RFC 4180 parser (unquoted empty = NULL,
  `""` = empty string), separator detection, mapping by name, `validateSeed` (types, NOT NULL,
  length, PK / UNIQUE duplicates, required columns, row width, foreign keys against the parent's
  seed, formula-looking text as a warning), `seedInsertOrder` (FK order, cycles reported,
  self-references ignored). Migration 25 `table_seeds` keyed by **table id** (content stored in
  the database, mapping by **field id**, so a canvas rename keeps it), routes
  `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/projects/:id/seeds[/:tableId]` (`edit` to change, audited, live
  `seeds-changed` notice), a `full` lock freezes the seed. Drivers got `insertRows` (bound
  parameters, batches, one transaction per table, all five engines). Deployment: seeds checked
  **before** the DDL (`SEEDS_NOT_DEPLOYABLE`), inserted after it, `if-empty` (default) or
  `append`, report in `deployment_history.seed_report`; the plan lists rows per table and can
  skip them. Editor: `SeedDialog.svelte` (file, separator, header, mode, mapping, checked
  preview), header icon at rest on a seeded table. **Verified:** `seeds.test.ts` (shared),
  `seeds/routes.test.ts` (SQLite end to end: FK order, refusal, `if-empty` on redeploy, lock),
  `e2e/seeds.e2e.ts`. **Still to do:** `upsert` / `replace` modes (engine-specific SQL);
  versioning with the project history (today the last file only — the audit log says who changed
  it); `json` / `xlsx` / `sql` sources; seeds are not part of the DBML text; ~~a seed whose CSV
  column was mapped to a deleted field silently ignores it~~ (2026-10-04: `validateSeed`
  reports it — kind `column-gone`, a warning, named by the file's header — in the seed dialog
  and in the plan's warning count, which the deployment dialog shows next to the table's rows
  since 2026-10-05); Oracle dates as text depend on
  `NLS_DATE_FORMAT`; a seed insert failing after the DDL leaves the DDL applied (reported, not
  rolled back); the security review of the Phase 27 rule. The original item, for the rest:
  **XL**. Entity `table_seeds(project_id, table_name, format,
file_ref, options_json, updated_at)`; an abstract `SeedSource` interface (`csv` first, then
  `json` / `xlsx` / `sql`); file stored server-side and **versioned with the project history**.
  Editor: "Données initiales" section in the table inspector — import, preview of the first
  rows, column mapping (separator, header, encoding), validation (types, NOT NULL, UNIQUE,
  FKs) **before** any deployment, 📄 icon on the node. CSV-formula-injection protection, size
  limit, encoding detection. Deployment: step added to `deploy.ts` after the DDL, inserting in
  **FK dependency order** (cycles detected and reported), in batches, in a transaction where
  the engine allows; per-table mode `insert-if-empty` (default) / `upsert` / `replace`; the
  dry-run lists `users : +248 lignes`. A seed inherits the `full` lock level (Phase 30).
  Open: size cap / streaming; mapping migration on column rename; DBML annotation syntax that
  stays valid DBML. **Blocked by:** locks (for the permission rule), workspace for the UI.
- [x] **Export current data as a seed** — done 2026-10-04.
      `POST /api/projects/:id/seeds/:tableId/from-database` (`seeds/fromDatabase.ts`): reads the table
      of the chosen linked database page by page (the backup runner's `queryRows` + page query,
      primary-key order) and returns it as a seed — CSV, mapping by field id — **without saving
      it**: the seed dialog shows it checked like a file ("Reprendre les lignes de la base"), and
      the console's explorer has a "Données initiales" button that opens that dialog when it is
      a project's Données & SQL tab (`WorkspaceContext.seedFromDatabase`). **Decisions taken:**
      _instance administrators only_ (every row of a table, like the console and the backups),
      audited `seed.read_database`; _only the columns schema and database share_, by name; a
      _binary column is left out_ (no CSV spelling) and named; past a seed's limits the _first
      rows_ are returned with `truncated` rather than an error. **Verified:**
      `seeds/routes.test.ts` (SQLite: key order, NULL vs empty string, quoting, blob column,
      missing table, rights, nothing saved, audit), `e2e/seed-from-database.e2e.ts`. **Not
      done:** the other four engines were not run live (it reuses the backup's page query —
      same caveat); dates come out as ISO text, which Oracle reads through `NLS_DATE_FORMAT`;
      no button in the admin console outside a project (no schema to map to); no `WHERE` /
      row choice; `connectionBudget` is not consulted.
- [~] **Test-data generation** — first slice done 2026-10-03. In-house, no Faker:
  `packages/shared/src/dataGenerator.ts` — seeded PRNG (mulberry32), 22 column generators, fr / en
  data, `suggestGenerator` (relation, increment, name, type), `generateRows` (NOT NULL, PK /
  UNIQUE with retries then a reported problem, declared length, FKs drawn from the parent's
  **seed** — never from a database), `toCsv`. Server: `modules/generator/` — settings per
  table (migration 26 `generator_configs`), `POST …/generators/:tableId/run` through the
  provider registry. UI: "Générer" tab of `SeedDialog` (`GeneratePanel.svelte`): volume, seed,
  locale, generator per column with values / range, preview, other rows, export CSV, use as
  initial data (then checked and saved like a file). **Decisions taken:** in-house generator (no
  dependency, deterministic across server and browser); v1 cap 10 000 rows (a seed's cap is
  50 000); destination (b) "insert into a non-production connection" **not built** — generating
  into the seed then deploying to a development connection covers it, with the production
  guards already in place. **Verified:** `dataGenerator.test.ts` (generated rows pass
  `validateSeed`), `generator/routes.test.ts`, `e2e/seeds.e2e.ts` (orders generated from the
  customers' seed, deployed). **Still to do:** regex and "copy of another column" generators,
  CHECK constraints, composite unique keys, inheritance by variants (Phase 35), progress /
  cancel for large volumes, direct insertion. The original item: **L**. Inspector tab "Générer": volume, reproducible seed,
  locale, per-column generator (heuristic by name — `email`, `phone`, `iban`, `city` — plus a
  catalogue: names, addresses, dates, numbers, weighted enums, UUID, text, regex, fixed
  value, copy of another column), integrity (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, types, lengths, FKs in
  dependency order, simple CHECK). Destinations: save as seed, insert into a **non-production**
  connection (never Prod without an explicit right), CSV export. Batches, progress, cancel.
  Table `generator_configs`, versioned with the project, inherited/overridable by variants.
  Open: Faker-like library vs. in-house; volume cap in v1.
- [~] **AI extension point for generation** — interface done 2026-10-03:
  `DataGeneratorProvider` + registry in `modules/generator/providers.ts`, `builtin` only,
  the run route takes `provider`; structure-only input and re-validation of the output by
  the seed checks hold by construction. Still to do when a provider exists: admin enablement
  per instance / project, journalled requests, quotas, encrypted provider key. The original
  item: **S** (interface only), the AI itself is later.
  `DataGeneratorProvider { id; generate({table, rows, locale, hints?, seed?}): AsyncIterable<Row[]> }`
  in the style of `drivers/index.ts` / plugins; `builtin` is the only provider at first.
  Guard-rails designed in from day one: the provider receives **structure only, never real
  data**; enabled by the admin per instance or project; requests journalled; quotas; provider
  key encrypted like other secrets; **output re-validated by the same constraints** before
  insertion. Open: may a future AI see anonymised samples?

## Phase 34 — Observability: journal, drift, health, alerts (plan §8, §9, §17, §18)

**Needs first:** schema fingerprint, job runner, capability levels (Prerequisites).

- [~] **Admin "Activité" tab** — first slice done 2026-10-03. Admin → Activité
  (`ActivityTab.svelte`) replaces the audit tab: period, type (category derived from the action
  — `activityCategory`, `AUDIT_ACTIONS` is now a runtime list), project, database, text search,
  cursor paging on `rowid`, expandable detail with a link to the project (its deployments tab for a
  deployment), CSV / JSON export of everything the filters match (10 000 rows; formula-looking
  CSV cells defused). Server: `listActivity` + `GET /api/admin/activity[/export]`; `audit()` takes
  a context (`projectId`, `connectionId`, defaulting from the target) and records the request id
  as `correlation_id` (Fastify now issues UUIDs); migration 27 adds and backfills the columns.
  **Decisions taken:** the Errors tab stays separate (different readers, different retention);
  retention stays `NEBULADB_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` (no Admin → Paramètres screen yet).
  **Verified:** `audit/routes.test.ts` (categories, filters, paging, export, admin-only),
  `e2e/activity.e2e.ts`. **Still to do:** source "Base" (lot 10, database-side logs) and the "hors
  Nebula uniquement" filter that needs it; ~~per-user filter~~ (done 2026-10-04: "Voir toute son activité" in an entry's detail sets
  `actorId`, kept in the export links); ~~duration / rows affected for SQL entries~~ (they were
  already in the `dbadmin.query` detail); ~~one database's journal~~ (done 2026-10-05: console →
  **Journal**, `features/admin/connections/JournalPanel.svelte` — the activity routes with
  `connectionId` fixed, period / type / author filters (`GET /api/admin/connections/:id/journal/actors`),
  paging, export; new entries `dbconn.open` (console opened, by an administrator or a member)
  and `dbconn.test` (form test of a saved connection, health check), written by an `onSend`
  hook in `dbAdmin/journalRoutes.ts` so `dbAdmin/routes.ts` stays as it was; new category
  _Surveillance_ (`monitoring.drift`, `monitoring.unreachable`, `monitoring.accounts*`): the
  watch now writes what it finds to the journal. Verified: `dbAdmin/queryStats.test.ts`,
  `e2e/connection-journal.e2e.ts`); hash-chain for a tamper-evident log;
  editor-SQL vs console-SQL told apart. The original item: **L**. One filterable view (source Nebula / Base; connection;
  user; type — structure · data · accounts · sessions · deployments; period; "hors Nebula
  uniquement"; search; CSV export) merging today's `AuditTab.svelte` and `ErrorsTab.svelte`;
  row detail panel (full SQL, duration, rows, IP, project, link to schema / deployment);
  cursor pagination. Server: extend `shared/audit.ts` with new event types (locks, structure
  policy, seeds, editor SQL, drift) and common fields `connection_id`, `project_id`,
  `correlation_id`; configurable retention; JSON/CSV export; optional hash-chain for a
  tamper-evident log. Reads stay out of the journal (as today).
- [~] **External-change detection ("Surveillance" per project)** — first slice done
  2026-10-03. **Job runner first:** `infrastructure/scheduler.ts` (`scheduleJob`: no overlap,
  never throws, `unref`ed, last run kept — `listJobs`; the older timers were not moved onto it).
  `modules/monitoring/`: `monitor_settings` + `drift_events` (migration 28), routes
  `GET/PUT /api/projects/:id/monitoring`, `POST …/monitoring/check`; a one-minute job checks the
  projects that are due, one database at a time (60 s read cut-off). Compared with the reference
  fingerprint of the last deployment / pull (strict `diffFingerprints`), ignore list by table
  name; a state is reported once (`live_hash`), an "Ignorer" is remembered, a deployment / pull
  resolves, an `unreachable` event is opened once and closed when the database answers. Kind
  `partial-deployment` when a deployment failed half-way since the reference. Marks the link
  out-of-schema (the existing banner), webhook `drift.detected` (Slack / Discord text too). UI: the
  "Surveillance" card on the Déploiements tab. **Decisions taken:** structure only (no views /
  functions / accounts, no data); deployments are **not** blocked while a drift is open; off by
  default, project administrators switch it on. **Verified:** `monitoring/routes.test.ts` (SQLite
  changed by hand: found once, ignored list, waved off, settled by a deployment; unreachable never
  a change; rights), `e2e/monitoring.e2e.ts`. **Found on the way, fixed:** dates from the server
  were formatted as local time (`toDate` in `i18n/formatters.ts`). **Still to do:** author / time
  of an outside change (capability level 2); ~~`/api/v1` and `openapi.ts`~~ (done 2026-10-04:
  `GET` / `PUT /api/v1/projects/:id/monitoring`, `POST …/monitoring/check` —
  `publicApi/monitoringRoutes.ts`, read behind `projects:read`, settings behind
  `projects:write` + administrator, the check for administrators under the deployment rate
  limit; verified in `monitoring/routes.test.ts` and `openapi.test.ts`; waving an event off
  ("Ignorer") is not in the API); e-mail alerts, grace delay,
  mute and reminders (the channels item below); severity by stage (critical on production);
  `connectionBudget` is not consulted (the job is sequential and bounded instead). The original
  item: **XL**. Project setting
  "Détecter les modifications externes à Nebula": interval (5 min … daily), scope
  (structure / + views, functions, procedures / + accounts and permissions), ignore list,
  alert channels, severity (critical on Prod connection), optional action "mark project
  divergent and block deployments". Mechanism: store the **reference fingerprint** after every
  successful deployment or pull; periodic re-introspection; on difference, look in
  `deployment_history` for a recent Nebula deployment that explains it, otherwise
  **external** (author and time when capability level 2 is available); event `drift.detected`;
  reference updated once resolved. Tables `schema_fingerprints`, `drift_events`,
  `monitor_settings`, `alert_acks`; routes `GET/PUT /api/projects/:id/monitoring`,
  `POST …/monitoring/check`, `GET …/drift`, `POST …/drift/:id/resolve`; also in `/api/v1` +
  `openapi.ts` (the sync test `openapi.test.ts` will fail until `docs/public-api.md` matches).
  A connection error is state "inconnu" + a separate "base injoignable" alert, never a false
  drift. Honours `connectionBudget` and `hostGuard`.
  **Open:** first scope = structure only; watch data (e.g. rows of a locked table)?; block
  deployments automatically while a drift is unresolved?
  **Accounts and permissions — done 2026-10-05.** An option of the watch, switched by an
  **instance administrator** only (`PUT /api/projects/:id/monitoring/accounts`; migration 37
  `monitor_settings.watch_accounts`, `account_baselines`, `drift_events.details_json`). Each
  linked database with accounts (not SQLite) is read through the administration driver's
  listing calls (`listPrincipals` / `listGrants`, SQL Server logins + the connection database's
  users, grants of built-in accounts not read, at most 300 accounts' grants per read) as the
  connection's service account under the `admin` connection budget, and turned into canonical
  lines (`monitoring/accountFingerprint.ts`: account, flags login / locked / superuser,
  memberships, one line per privilege; sorted, so the hash ignores listing order). First read =
  reference; a difference = event `accounts` (once per state), audit `monitoring.accounts`,
  `notifyFollowers("drift", { kind: "accounts", connection, changes })` to project
  administrators only, webhook `drift.detected` with `kind: "accounts"` and counts by change
  type. **Nebula's own changes:** a `preHandler` / `onResponse` pair on
  `POST /api/admin/connections/:id/users` (executed, by an instance administrator) reads the
  accounts before and after; what changed in between is applied to the reference
  (`applyAccountDelta`), so a pending outside change stays reported. **Accepter l'état actuel**
  (`POST …/monitoring/accounts/accept`) takes the last state read as the reference.
  **Decisions taken:** the findings name accounts, so `GET …/monitoring` gives them (and the
  watch's state) to instance administrators only; notifications and webhooks carry counts, not
  names; the option only runs while the project's watch is on; reading fails → kept as
  `lastError` on the card, never an alert. **Verified:** `monitoring/accountFingerprint.test.ts`
  (stable, order-insensitive, privilege / role / lock / create / drop, Nebula delta),
  `monitoring/accountWatch.test.ts` (rights, SQLite hidden, alert once, notification without
  names, Nebula's console change not alerted while the outside one stays, accept, cascade),
  `monitoring/accountReader.live.test.ts` against the PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQL Server
  containers. **Found on the way, fixed:** PostgreSQL `listGrants` did not read a table's
  default (NULL ACL) owner privileges, so they seemed to appear on the first grant.
  **Not done:** views / functions / procedures; Oracle checked by code only (no container);
  the window between the two reads around a console change attributes to Nebula anything
  done elsewhere in those milliseconds; `/api/v1` does not expose the accounts watch.
- [~] **Drift UI** — editor banner (`editor/drift/DriftBanner.svelte`) and notifications exist; the per-project watch settings screen, the differences page and the alert centre do not. Original plan: **L**. Editor banner ("modifiée en dehors d'Nebula — n différences" with
  Voir / Mettre à jour le schéma / Réappliquer le schéma / Ignorer), differences page reusing
  `editor/compare/` with per-line Import / Revert / Ignore (ignore list = exceptions), "divergent"
  badge on nodes and a red dot on the project list, admin **alert centre** (bell, ack, history).
- [~] **Alert channels and noise control** — e-mail, `drift.detected` webhook, acknowledge and mute are built on the server (`modules/monitoring/`); the UI for mute and watch settings was removed. Original plan: **M**. In-app, e-mail (SMTP exists —
  `infrastructure/mailer.ts`), webhook (new event `drift.detected` in `modules/webhooks/`,
  signing and retries already there; update `docs/webhooks.md`). One alert per detection (not
  per table), grace delay, mute, acknowledge, reminder after N hours.
- [ ] **Database-side logs, levels 1–2** — **XL**. New `modules/dbMonitor/` with per-engine
      collectors next to `dbAdmin/drivers`. Level 1: sessions / recent statements
      (`pg_stat_activity` / `pg_stat_statements`, `performance_schema`, DMVs, `V$SESSION`); level
      2: DDL / audit trail only if the DBA configured it (PostgreSQL event trigger or log,
      MySQL `general_log` table / audit plugin, SQL Server Extended Events / default trace, Oracle
      unified audit). **Nebula never configures server-side audit itself** — it supplies the
      script and verifies it works. Table `db_activity_log` (short, capped retention; statement
      text truncated and literals masked). Capability map shown in the connection editor.
      Open: default retention; syslog / SIEM export.
- [~] **Health dashboard** — `HealthPanel` (probe, latency, sizes, sessions, blocking locks) is built; the card on the connections list and growth per table are not. Original plan: **L**. "Santé" tab + card on the connections list: latency,
  version, uptime, size and growth per table, sessions, blocking locks (link to the sessions
  panel and its existing **kill**), slow statements (link to Phase 36). Short aggregated
  series kept server-side, rate-limited sampling.
- [ ] **Traffic: queries and data volume** — first piece of "Nebula's own traffic" done
      2026-10-05: per connection, the SQL console's statements grouped by shape
      (`dbAdmin/sqlShape.ts`: comments dropped, every literal → `?`, lists collapsed), counted per
      UTC day in `query_stats` (migration 37; runs, failures, total / max ms, rows, last author),
      kept `NEBULADB_QUERY_STATS_RETENTION_DAYS` (30), shown in console → Journal → **Requêtes**
      (frequency / slowest / total, badge "Mesuré par Nebula"; the duration includes opening the
      connection). Fed by `recordQuery`, so the members' console (`/api/connections/…`) counts too.
      Verified: `dbAdmin/queryStats.test.ts`, `e2e/connection-journal.e2e.ts`. The rest below is
      still to do. **L**, admin only, "if possible". Per connection:
      query count (by type), data **sent** (download) and **received** (upload), rows, per
      user / application / host (per-account breakdown off by default — it exposes account names).
      Sources by engine: MySQL `Questions`/`Com_*` + `Bytes_sent/received`
      (`status_by_account`); Oracle `user calls`/`execute count` + SQL*Net byte stats (`V$SYSSTAT`,
      `V$SESSTAT`); SQL Server `Batch Requests/sec` + `sys.dm_exec_connections` (partial);
      PostgreSQL `xact_commit/rollback` + `pg_stat_statements` — **no native network bytes**, volume
      is an estimate (rows × average row size) — and SQLite only via Nebula. Every figure carries
      an **accuracy badge** (exact / estimated / unavailable / measured by Nebula); never present
      an estimate as a measurement. **Nebula's own traffic is measured exactly and shown apart**
      ("Via Nebula"). Counters are cumulative → deltas, **ignore negative deltas** (server restart).
      Storage `connection_metrics(connection_id, bucket_start, resolution, queries, by_type_json,
bytes_out, bytes_in, rows_returned, quality)`, downsampled minute (7 d) → hour (90 d) → day
      (2 y). Open: accept an estimate for PostgreSQL?; threshold alerts; per-client chargeback.
- [ ] **Visual EXPLAIN** — **L**. "Expliquer" (plain `EXPLAIN`) and "Analyser" (`EXPLAIN
ANALYZE`, **read-only statements only**, explicit confirmation, time cap) in the SQL panel and
      console; per-engine normalisation (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle; SQLite
      `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` simplified) into a node tree coloured by cost, estimated vs. actual rows,
      slowest node highlighted, raw text available. **Blocked by:** SQL panel (Phase 31).
- [~] **Subscription notifications** — first slice done 2026-10-04: **follow a project,
  in-app**. Migration 34 `subscriptions(user_id, scope_type, scope_id, events_json)` (only
  `scope_type = 'project'` is written) and `notifications`. `modules/notifications/`:
  `GET/PUT /api/projects/:id/subscription` (one's own, on a project one can see),
  `GET /api/notifications`, `POST /api/notifications/read`; `notifyFollowers` called where
  things happen — deployments and rollbacks, lock placed / lifted, seed set / removed, drift
  found by the watch. UI: the eye in the project header (`FollowMenu.svelte`, a tick per
  event) and the notification centre (`NotificationBell.svelte`) in the project header and
  on the dashboard, read again every minute and when opened.
  **Decisions taken** (the "decide opt-out rules once, for all" of the item):
  - _Opt-in, per project, per event_ — nobody is subscribed to anything by default, not even
    a project's owner. No instance-wide "everything on Prod" yet.
  - _Never one's own doing_ (by account id, or by e-mail for a deployment).
  - _Never what the follower could not see_: the level the event's own screen asks for is
    checked for each follower **when the event happens** — a deployment needs project
    `administrator` (the deployment-history rule), the others `view`. A grant that went
    since the subscription tells nothing more.
  - _A notification is a pointer_: an event name and a few names (table, connection, who),
    worded by the client in the reader's language; 200 kept per account, older ones trimmed
    as new ones arrive. The record stays the audit log and the deployment history.
  - _Structure changes are not an event_: every edit of a schema would be one. "The schema
    changed since you last looked" needs a digest, which does not exist yet.

  **Verified:** `notifications/routes.test.ts` (rights, own action, level per event, read,
  unsubscribe, revoked grant, cascade), `e2e/notifications.e2e.ts` (two accounts).
  **Still to do:** e-mail and webhook channels and the daily digest (`sendMail` exists; the
  per-user opt-out is the subscription itself); following a **table**, a stage or a variant;
  events: structure change (digest), failed backup; ~~comment replies and `@mentions`~~ (done
  2026-10-05 as direct notifications `mention` / `reply`, Phase 21); ~~the bell polls, it is not pushed~~ (pushed 2026-10-05 while the project is open:
  `notifyFollowers` → `notifyProjectUsers` → `Room.announceTo`, a `notification` notice sent
  only to the connections of the accounts that were told — a room connection now knows its
  user id; the bell refetches on it (`notifications/inboxPush.svelte.ts`). Another project
  open, or the dashboard, still waits for the one-minute poll); no notification preferences page;
  drift alerts and this centre are one list but drift has no acknowledge / mute yet.

## Phase 35 — Derived projects: base + variants (plan §10)

> Delivered differently from the plan below: a variant is a full copy of the original (one level), with
> a "Variantes" tab and an on-demand three-way merge (see `docs/etat-des-features.md`, section 2). The
> overlay model, published versions and pinning below were not built; the items stay open as the
> original design.

A base project (e.g. **DeepDetect**) and variants (**L'Oréal**, **La Poste**) that inherit it,
customise it, and may target another engine. **Needs first:** stable ids, role matrix, locks.

- [ ] **Data model: base + overlay** — **XL**. `projects.parent_id`, `base_version`,
      `follow_mode` (`latest | pinned | detached`), `target_engine`; `project_versions(project_id,
version, snapshot_json, notes)` — a version is an explicit **"Publier vN"**, not every
      keystroke; `variant_ops(project_id, seq, op, target_id, payload_json)` storing structured
      operations (`addColumn`, `changeType`, `dropTable`, `renameColumn`, …). A variant's schema =
      parent @ version + overlay. One inheritance level at first; a variant can be **detached**
      into a standalone project. Routes `…/variants`, `…/variants/:id/resolve`, `…/merge`; also in
      `/api/v1` + `openapi.ts`. Open: DBML export of a variant (resolved only, or base + patch).
- [ ] **Variants UI** — **L**. Tree view in the project list (`Liste | Arbre`), "Nouveau ▾ →
      Variante d'un projet…"; breadcrumb in the editor with views **Résolu / Surcouche seule /
      Base**; graph states inherited (muted) / added ＋ / modified ~ / removed (hatched); editing an
      inherited element offers "pour ce client uniquement" (overlay op) or "dans la base" (impact
      analysis); a **variants matrix** (objects × variants, engine row, current stage column).
- [ ] **Base update merge** — **L**. When the base publishes vN+1: per-variant 3-way merge
      screen — non-conflicting changes auto-applied, conflicts resolved per line (keep variant /
      take base / edit); variants choose follow-latest (alert + merge), pinned, or detached.
      Notification through Phase 34 channels.
- [ ] **Engine per variant** — **L**. Type-mapping table per engine (extends
      `ConvertTypesModal.svelte` and `dbml-engine`), fidelity-loss warnings (no equivalent type,
      sequence vs. identity, case sensitivity), manual type override as an overlay op, and DDL
      generated for the **variant's** engine (the five drivers already exist).
- [ ] **Variants × the rest** — **M**. Locks inherited (a base lock holds in every variant;
      a variant can add its own); per-variant rights (a team manages "L'Oréal" without seeing "La
      Poste"); each variant has its own connections, environments chain, deployment history, seeds
      (overriding the base's), drift reference and linter rules (hardenable); recommendations from
      a client's Prod apply to its variant or are proposed to the base.
      **Open:** can a variant add a seed to a table locked in the base?; hierarchy depth later
      (base → sector → client).

## Phase 36 — Schema quality and performance (plan §15, §16)

- [~] **Schema linter** — first slice done 2026-10-04. `packages/dbml-engine/src/lint.ts` (pure,
  shared by the editor and the server): twelve rules — `pk-required`, `fk-indexed`,
  `naming-snake-case`, `varchar-length`, `timestamps`, `no-float-money`, `table-description`,
  two fed by lists of the project's own, `forbidden-type` and `required-column`, and three
  added 2026-10-04: `column-description` (one finding per table; `id` keys and the timestamp
  columns are not asked for one; off / off / info), `personal-data-class` (a column classified
  personal or sensitive in a table that is not; off / warning / error — **so a Strict project
  that blocks deployments on errors can be refused after upgrading**, said in the changelog)
  and `fk-on-delete` (a relation without `ON DELETE`, reported on the table that carries it;
  off / off / info) — each at a
  level (`off` / `info` / `warning` / `error`) set by a profile (Souple / Standard / Strict) or
  one by one (Perso, read against Standard). Exceptions per table: in the settings (keyed by
  table id) or `lint-ignore: rule-id[, …]` / `lint-ignore: all` in the table's note. Two **safe
  fixes** (`applyLintFix`): an `id` key on a table with neither a key nor an `id` column, a plain
  index on a foreign-key column. Server: migration 31 `lint_settings` (one JSON document per
  project, checked on the way out as on the way in), `GET/PUT /api/projects/:id/lint` (`view` to
  read, project administrator to change, audited `project.lint`, live `lint-changed` notice),
  `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/lint` (+ `openapi.ts`, `docs/public-api.md`), and **"an error stops a
  deployment"** (off by default) enforced in `deployToConnection` before any connection is opened
  (`409 LINT_BLOCKS_DEPLOYMENT`, app and `/api/v1`). Editor: the **Problèmes** workspace tab
  (`features/editor/lint/`: findings by table, level filter, open in schema, fix, ignore, the
  rules card), the count on the tab, errors and warnings on the node badge, every finding
  underlined in the DBML buffer.
  **Decisions taken:**
  - _The linter owns "no primary key"._ `validateProject` still reports it (tagged
    `code: "no-primary-key"`) for its other callers; the editor drops that one and shows the
    rule's finding, at the project's level — so a Souple project can no longer be nagged about
    it by a hard-coded warning in the DBML editor either (removed).
  - _The annotation lives in the note, not in a `//` comment_: comments do not survive the DBML
    round trip, the note does — and it follows history and, later, variants.
  - _Exceptions and rules are the administrators'_; anyone with `edit` can still write the
    annotation in a note. A fix is an ordinary schema edit: `edit`, and not on a table whose
    lock binds you.
  - _Only `error` blocks_, and only when asked; `info` findings stay off the node badge.

  **Verified:** `lint.test.ts` (engine), `lint/routes.test.ts` (rights, invalid settings, the
  public report, cascade on project delete, a SQLite deployment refused then allowed),
  `openapi.test.ts`, `e2e/lint.e2e.ts` (real browser: list, both fixes, profile, exception,
  custom rule, reload, squiggles, open in schema).
  **Presets and custom rules — done 2026-10-05** (the owner's request: a library of lint
  configurations managed by administrators, one applied to a project, one default for every
  project that chose none, and a version each project may edit for its own exceptions and rules).
  Migration 38: `lint_presets`, `lint_settings.preset_id` and `use_own` (every project that
  had settings keeps them as its own version). `modules/lint/repository.ts#resolveProjectLint` is
  the one place that decides a project's rules — own version, else its preset, else the instance
  default preset, else the built-in ones — and the editor, `/api/v1` and the deployment check all
  read it. `/api/admin/lint-presets` (instance administrators): list, create, edit, delete,
  `PUT …/default`, `POST …/:id/apply`; `GET|PUT /api/projects/:id/lint` answers `{ settings,
source, presets }` and takes `{ settings }` (own version) or `{ presetId }`. UI: Admin → Lint
  (`features/admin/lint/`), the origin bar and the custom-rules editor in the Problèmes tab.
  **Custom rules** are declarative — a case-insensitive regular expression (200 characters, 20
  rules per settings) on a table or column name, an optional scope on the table name, a level
  and a message with `{table}` / `{column}` — so a setting never runs code; the pattern runs
  against names of 255 characters at most. They can block a deployment and be excepted
  (`custom:<id>` in the settings' exceptions or in a note's `lint-ignore`). **Verified:**
  `lint.test.ts` (engine), `lint/routes.test.ts` (rights, library, default, own version,
  apply, deletion, deployment refused on the default's rules), `migrations.test.ts`,
  `e2e/lint-presets.e2e.ts`. **Not verified by hand:** nobody has used the admin screen.
  **Still to do:** a preset cannot hold per-table exceptions (they name one project's tables);
  `applying` a preset drops a project's own version without asking its administrators (the
  audit log keeps who did it); a regular expression can still be slow on a pathological
  pattern (bounded by name length, not by time); no import / export of a preset between
  instances; no `lint.changed` webhook.
  **Still to do:**
  - Pluralisation / prefix conventions as built-in rules (a prefix is now a custom rule).
  - Per-**column** exceptions and annotations (needs the column identity of the prerequisites).
  - ~~The plan step could warn before "Deploy" is pressed~~ — done 2026-10-04: the plan answers
    `blockers` (`lintErrors`, `waitsForStage`) and the dialog shows them on its first step —
    and, since later that day, names the blocking findings (`lintFindings`, the first 20) with
    a button to the Problèmes tab (`lint/check.ts#blockingLintFindings`, covered by
    `e2e/lint.e2e.ts`). The read-only "check differences" dialog shows neither.
  - ~~Instance-wide default profile~~ — the default preset (2026-10-05, above); rules per
    variant (Phase 35: inherit and tighten).
  - Findings on enums and on types unknown to the target engine (a relation without
    `ON DELETE` is `fk-on-delete`, above); `fk-indexed` only sees single-column foreign keys
    (so does the model). None of the three new rules has a one-click fix.
  - The MCD view shows no finding; the canvas badge of an unselected table was not re-checked.
  - ~~A CI example in `docs/public-api.md`~~ — added 2026-10-06 ("In a CI job": lint, drift
    check, deploy; as a shell script and as a GitHub Actions job). Its `jq` filters were read,
    not run (no `jq` on the machine), and the Actions job never ran. A `lint.changed` webhook
    is still not there.

- [~] **Data dictionary** — first slice done 2026-10-04. `packages/dbml-engine/src/dictionary.ts`
  (pure): a table's or column's note is its **description** followed by bracketed annotations —
  `'Customer accounts. [owner: crm-team] [class: personal] [tags: rgpd, core]'` — read by
  `parseNote`, written by `formatNote`; `buildDictionary` (tables by name, columns with their
  constraints and foreign-key target, completeness), `dictionaryToMarkdown` / `…Csv` / `…Html`
  (one self-contained page, no script). Classification: `public` / `internal` / `personal` /
  `sensitive`. Editor: the **Dictionnaire** workspace tab (`features/editor/dictionary/`):
  completeness bar, search, filters (to document / personal data), every field saved into the
  note when left, the three exports. `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/dictionary[?format=…]`. The
  linter's `table-description` rule reads the description only: a note made of annotations
  does not count.
  **Decisions taken:**
  - _In the note, as text_ — the plan's "stored in the schema": it survives the DBML round
    trip, history, export, a pull request on the file, and variants later, with no table of
    its own. The price: a note is one line of DBML, so a description is one line; and the
    annotations show wherever the raw note shows (canvas tooltip, DBML hover).
  - _Owner is free text_ (a team's or a person's name), not a reference to an account: it must
    still read right in an exported file and after the account is gone.
  - _Who edits:_ anyone with `edit`, except on a table whose lock binds them — a lock already
    froze notes.
  - _Each edit re-reads the live note_ before writing, so two people documenting one table do
    not undo each other's field (last write wins per annotation, not per note).

  **Verified:** `dictionary.test.ts` (parse / format, DBML round trip, completeness, the three
  exports — pipe, formula-looking text and markup defused — and the lint rule),
  `publicApi/routes.test.ts`, `openapi.test.ts`, `e2e/dictionary.e2e.ts` (typed in a browser,
  found in the exported DBML, kept across a reload, filters, Markdown download, the lint rule).
  **Still to do:** PDF export; the diagram in the HTML export; a multi-line description (needs
  the serializer to write `'''` notes); owner picked from teams; ~~hiding the annotations where
  the note is displayed~~ (done 2026-10-04: `readableNote` on the canvas tooltips and the DBML
  hover — the note editor and the DBML text keep the raw note); ~~a lint rule for undocumented **columns** and for a personal column in
  a table not classified as such~~ (done 2026-10-04, see the linter); ~~enums are not in the
  dictionary~~ (done 2026-10-04: `DataDictionary.enums` — values with their note, and the
  columns typed with the enum — shown read-only after the tables, in the Markdown and HTML
  exports and the API's JSON; not in the CSV, not in the completeness figure, and a value's
  note is still edited in the schema, not in this tab); AI-assisted filling; the
  RGPD report and masking of Phase 38 that this classification prepares.

- [~] **Index suggestions and clean-up** — suggestions from the SQL journal, added to the project's indexes, are built (`journal.indexes`); unused-index and redundancy analysis are not. Original plan: **L**. Ranked list (impact) of indexes to create
  (from analysed queries + stats), duplicates / redundant, and unused ones (`pg_stat_user_
indexes`, `sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats`, `performance_schema`, Oracle views) with an
  adjustable duration threshold and a warning when stats were **reset recently**; also unused
  tables / columns. **Never applied directly:** each suggestion becomes a _pending change in
  the schema_ ("＋ proposé") that follows the normal path (review, plan, promotion, backup).
  Generated DDL adapted to the engine (`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, `ONLINE = ON`, size / time
  estimate). **Blocked by:** health dashboard (Phase 34) and the query collection below.
- [ ] **Query advisor (opt-in per connection, off by default)** — **XL**. Detect SQL
      statements run on a database and propose (a) **query rewrites** and (b) **database changes**.
  - _Activation:_ admin-only, off on Prod until explicitly confirmed; sources (engine stats —
    `pg_stat_statements`, `events_statements_summary_by_digest`, Query Store /
    `dm_exec_query_stats`, `V$SQL` — plus statements run from Nebula; slow-query log
    optionally); sampling interval, retention (default 14 d), "slow" threshold; privacy
    toggles (replace literals by `?`, never store parameters); `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` never / on
    demand read-only, with a load budget (~2 %).
  - _Collection:_ normalise + fingerprint each statement, aggregate calls / total / mean time /
    rows / plan. Reuses level 1 of the DB-side logs.
  - _Analysis, three layers:_ (1) rewrite — `SELECT *`, function on an indexed column
    (`lower(email)`), leading `LIKE '%x'`, implicit cast, `NOT IN` with NULL, correlated
    subquery → join, deep `OFFSET` → keyset, superfluous `DISTINCT`/`ORDER BY`, **N+1** bursts,
    join without condition; (2) plan — full scan on a big table, disk sort, badly wrong
    estimates, costly nested loops; (3) database — missing / redundant / unused index (column
    order, covering, partial), mismatched join types, stale statistics (`ANALYZE`), table to
    partition, materialised view or denormalisation for a repeated aggregate, big `text`
    column read everywhere.
  - _Output:_ ranked recommendations with before / after diff, cause, **confidence level**
    (🟢 plan observed … estimate); impact estimate from measured times, and for indexes a
    hypothetical-index check where the engine allows (`hypopg` on PostgreSQL) — otherwise
    labelled "estimation". Ignore button remembered; no recommendation on too few samples.
  - _Apply:_ a rewrite replaces the text only for statements living **in Nebula**; for an
    external application it is "copy" with the diff (Nebula cannot see app code). Database
    changes go through "Proposer dans le schéma" (see index suggestions). A recommendation
    seen on a client's Prod is scoped to that **variant** or proposed to the base.
  - _Guard-rails:_ statistics-view reads only, bounded budget and interval, `connectionBudget`
    honoured; statements may contain personal data → normalise at collection, short retention,
    admin only, audited; turning it off **stops collection and purges** what was collected.
  - _Optional AI:_ `QueryAdvisorProvider` interface; it gets only the **normalised** statement,
    table structure and plan — never values or data — and its proposals are re-validated
    (parse, result-equivalence on a sample when possible, `EXPLAIN` of the result) before being
    shown with a confidence level.
  - _Open:_ multi-dialect SQL parser (`node-sql-parser` vs. an in-house analyser limited to
    `SELECT`); show recommendations (without statement text) to non-admins; measure the real
    before / after gain of a deployed index.
    **Blocked by:** DB-side logs level 1, visual EXPLAIN, index suggestions, variants (for the
    scoping rule).

## Phase 37 — Visual overhaul (plan §7)

Runs alongside the other phases once the Phase 29 components exist; each screen is its own PR
with before / after captures. **Open:** do it before the new features or in parallel (plan
proposes in parallel, core components first); Figma mock-ups before implementation?

- [ ] **Auth screens** (`features/auth/`) — showcase for the new style.
- [ ] **Project list** (`projects/ProjectListScreen.svelte`) — tree-ready, densities.
- [ ] **Toolbar and canvas** (`ProjectToolbar.svelte`, `canvas/*Toolbar*`) — menus on the new
      `Menu`.
- [ ] **Panels** — DBML, history, comments, settings.
- [ ] **Database console and administration** (`admin/connections/*`, `admin/*`).
- [ ] **Modals** — everything through `Modal` + `ConfirmDialog`.
- [ ] **Cross-cutting principles** — one hierarchy (surface → card → row), comfortable /
      compact density, short consistent transitions, illustrated empty states, loading skeletons,
      first-class dark mode, `prefers-reduced-motion`. Closes Phase 22's "visually out of step" and
      feeds its accessibility audit.

## Phase 38 — Candidate ideas, not yet arbitrated

Proposed 2026-10-02; **none is decided** — the owner reviews them one by one. Numbers are those
of the discussion. Cut or promote into a phase above.

- **Change safety:** 1 review-before-deploy (approvers on Prod) · 2 deployment windows and
  freeze · 3 pre-deploy impact analysis.
- **Data:** 10 anonymisation rules (PROD → DEV copies) · 12 row editor in the explorer · 13
  saved / shared queries with parameters · 14 relation explorer (follow FKs row to row).
- **Schema:** 20 table templates (audit columns, soft delete, multi-tenant).
- **Governance:** 21 RGPD classification + "where is personal data" report · 22 dynamic masking
  for non-admins · 23 just-in-time elevated access · 24 exportable audit report.
- **Integration:** 25 CLI + CI/CD (overlaps Phase 27 "Phase E") · 26 Git sync of the DBML ·
  27 migration generation (Flyway, Liquibase, Prisma, Alembic, Knex — as plugins, see Phase 21)
  · 28 code generation (types, ORM models, DTOs, API client) · 29 internal / public schema
  documentation site.
- **Collaboration:** 30 anchored comments with resolution · 31 schema branches (close to
  Phase 35 — decide whether variants cover it) · 33 diagram presentation mode.
- **Observability:** 35 threshold alerts · 36 table-size history.
- **UX:** 37 global command palette (`Ctrl+K`) · 38 cross-search (schemas, queries, journal) ·
  40 customisable shortcuts and synced preferences.

## Existing open items from earlier phases

### Phase 6 — Multi-user editing

- [~] **Field-level CRDT merge within one table** — **S-M**, low priority. Two users editing
  different fields of the _same_ table still last-write-wins: `getTablesMap` in
  `packages/shared/src/yjsBinding.ts` stores each table as one opaque `Y.Map` entry. **How:**
  one Yjs sub-entry per field — touches `yjsBinding.ts`, `apps/server/src/realtime/room.ts`
  and every web mutation doing `tablesMap.set(id, {...current, ...patch})`. Revisit only if
  reported. **Note:** the table-lock enforcement of Phase 30 touches the same code — decide
  together.

### Phase 17 — Plugin system

- [ ] **Plugin-provided UI** — **L**, speculative: a plugin renders its own HTML in a sandboxed
      iframe over `postMessage` (today `PluginHost.ts`/`sandboxRuntime.ts` only run sandboxed
      exporter / importer functions). Not worth it until a real plugin needs more than a settings
      form.
- [ ] **Server-installed / team-shared plugins** — **M**, deliberately deferred: plugins live in
      one browser's `localStorage`; sharing means the server storing third-party code — a trust-
      model change.
- [ ] **Plugin publishing / discovery** — **M**. Blocked by the item above.

### Phase 19 — Security

- [ ] **Passkeys / WebAuthn** — **L**. No code yet; TOTP covers the shorter 2FA effort.

### Phase 20 — Accounts

- [ ] **Notifications** — **M**. Nobody is told they were added to a project/team or that a
      comment got a reply. `sendMail` and `shared/emailTemplates.ts` exist; what's left is
      which events notify and a per-user opt-out. **Folded into Phase 34 "Subscription
      notifications"**. Comment replies and `@mentions` are done in-app (2026-10-05, see Phase 21
      "Comment mentions"); still open: being added to a project/team, e-mail, opt-out.
- [ ] **Per-project/team roles beyond view/edit/administrator** — **M**, only on real demand.
      **Related:** the role matrix prerequisite and Phase 30 locks may force this earlier.

### Phase 21 — Product

- [x] **Comment mentions / notifications** — **M**. Done 2026-10-05. `@` in a comment box
      (`MentionTextArea.svelte`, keyboard, filtered as you type) offers the accounts that can see
      the project (`GET /api/projects/:id/mentionable`, filtered server side with
      `getEffectivePermission`, never the author, no e-mail address given). A mention is stored
      as `@[Name](account-id)` in the comment text (`shared/commentMentions.ts`; comments also
      carry `authorId`), shown highlighted. The client says a comment was written
      (`POST …/comment-notices`, needs `edit`; the server reads the mentions from the text) and
      `notifyCommentAddressees` decides: events `mention` and `reply` (a reply in a thread the
      person wrote in; a mention wins), **never own comment, never someone who cannot see the
      project now**, pushed through `Room.announceTo`.
      **Decisions:** a mention reaches its person **even without following the project** (it is
      an address); no migration (the notification payload is JSON); the payload is `{by, table,
column}` — names, never the comment text; a mention of someone without access is dropped
      silently (no oracle on who exists); the notice is trusted for table/column names and for
      the thread's author ids (an editor could ping any account that can see the project —
      equivalent to mentioning it). **Verified:** `notifications/comments.test.ts`,
      `shared/commentMentions.test.ts`, `commentNotice.test.ts`, `e2e/comment-mentions.e2e.ts`.
      **Not done:** mentions in sticky notes / column notes; e-mail; editing a comment (there is
      none); a deleted account's mentions keep its old name; a thread's authors are known only
      for comments written since `authorId` exists.
- [~] **Export to other ecosystems** — Prisma and JSON Schema are done (built-in exporters, with TypeScript and Mermaid); TypeORM and GraphQL SDL are not — **M each**,
  as plugins, deliberately not core.
- [ ] **Not done on the API:** per-key usage quotas, multi-project key scoping, request
      validation from the OpenAPI schemas. **Done 2026-10-05:** webhooks under `/api/v1` (list,
      create, change, delete, test, deliveries — `publicApi/webhookRoutes.ts`, read behind
      `projects:read`, the rest behind `projects:write`, project administrators only) and
      **secret rotation** (`POST …/webhooks/:hookId/rotate-secret`, "Régénérer le secret" in
      the dialog): a new secret for the same webhook, shown once; the old one stops signing at
      once, also for a delivery waiting to be retried. The rules moved to
      `webhooks/service.ts`, shared by both sets of routes. Verified in
      `webhooks/routes.test.ts` (a real receiver checks the signature before and after),
      `openapi.test.ts`, `e2e/webhooks.e2e.ts`. Not there: a grace period during which both
      secrets sign.

### Phase 22 — UX

- [ ] **Landing page and app visually out of step** — **M**; revisit with a browser pass (see
      Phase 37).
- [ ] **Mobile / tablet: decide, don't drift** — **S** to document, **XL** to build. Svelte Flow
      assumes a wide pointer screen. Undecided.
- [ ] **Accessibility audit** — **M-L**. No systematic contrast / keyboard / screen-reader check
      has been run on the Svelte UI. Do it once the Phase 29 components exist.

### Phase 23 — Code health

- [~] **File-size watchlist** (2026-10-04 counts; split opportunistically, none is a bug):
  `features/editor/ProjectEditor.svelte` **892 l.** — the workspace shell, six tabs and a dozen
  lazily mounted dialogs live there; it peaked at 1 002 on 2026-10-04, when the schema-quality
  logic (`lint/schemaQuality.svelte.ts`) and the SQL drawer state (`sql/sqlDrawer.svelte.ts`)
  were moved out. Next candidates: the block of dialogs (one component taking a `dialogs`
  state object) and the history-preview state. · `features/connections/DeploymentModal.svelte`
  **363 l.** (742 before it was split by step on 2026-10-05 into
  `connections/deployment/`: diff, risks, SQL, result, tabs, stage skip — the modal keeps the
  state, the loading and the navigation) ·
  `features/plugins/communityTemplates.ts` 723 l. (mostly data) ·
  `features/editor/dbml/symbols.ts` 581 l. · `packages/dbml-engine/src/dbml.ts` 537 l. ·
  `features/editor/canvas/CanvasArea.svelte` 487 l. · `features/editor/canvas/autoLayout.ts`
  465 l. · `features/admin/connections/UsersPanel.svelte` 447 l. ·
  `apps/server/src/modules/connections/repository.ts` has grown a lot with instance-level
  connections — worth a look.
- [ ] **Confirm two perf regressions flagged by the Svelte migration bench** — **S**
      (single pass): `zoom-links-on` at "complet" detail
      0→29 ms blocking at 100 tables and 4→40 ms at 500; `delete-columns` at 500 tables +~6 ms. Small
      in absolute terms; needs a second measurement pass.

### Phase 25 — Release process

- [~] **Versioning / git tags** — SemVer decided (`0.y.z` until the V1 checklist clears),
  documented in `CHANGELOG.md`; `git tag -l` is still empty and every workspace is `0.0.1`.
  Cutting the first tagged release is a deliberate release action.

### Phase 27 — Live database link & deployment

Connects a project to a real database: read-only introspection, drift detection, migration SQL
generation, apply / rollback with per-environment history
(`apps/server/src/modules/connections/`,
`packages/dbml-engine/src/{migrationDiff,migrationGenerator,rollbackGenerator}.ts`,
`DeploymentModal.svelte`). Connections are instance-level since 2026-10-02 and managed in the
admin console (`apps/web/src/features/admin/connections/`, `apps/server/src/modules/dbAdmin/`).
**This is the one area where a mistake can destroy a client's data — each remaining gap needs
its own security review before being closed, not an audit afterwards.**

- [~] **Personal database accounts** — first slice done 2026-10-05 (the owner's request: no
  shared account, so the database's logs and permissions are per person). A connection has an
  **account mode** (migration 35 `db_connections.auth_mode`): `shared` — as before — or
  `personal`, where each user gives their own account (`db_connection_credentials`: name in
  clear, password encrypted with the instance secret, one per user and connection).
  `connections/personalCredentials.ts#configForActor` swaps the account in at the two places
  every driver is created (`createDatabaseDriver`, `createAdminDriver`), so no route can be
  forgotten; who is asking comes from the request (`infrastructure/actor.ts`, an
  `AsyncLocalStorage` opened by the first `onRequest` hook and named once the session or API
  key is resolved). Routes `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/connections/:id/credentials`,
  `GET /api/admin/connections/:id/credentials`; UI: the mode in `ConnectionEditModal`,
  `PersonalAccountButton` / `PersonalAccountDialog` in the workspace bar and the admin list.
  **Decisions taken:**
  - _An option per connection, not the rule for all_: existing connections stay `shared`, so
    nothing breaks on upgrade. **Open for the owner:** make `personal` the default for new
    connections, or the only mode.
  - _A person never falls back to the stored account_ — no account, `409
PERSONAL_CREDENTIALS_REQUIRED`, before the target is touched.
  - _The stored account becomes a service account_ for work nobody is behind: the watch (also
    a check asked for by hand — its findings are the project's), scheduled backups, the health
    check (also by hand — "offline" must not mean "this administrator has no account"). So
    those are **not** attributed to a person in the database's logs.
  - _Tried before kept_: saving an account opens a connection with it; 10 saves a minute, so
    the route is no way to guess a database password.
  - _Only instance administrators set the mode_ (like the structure policy); a project route
    ignores it. Who may give an account: instance administrators and administrators of a
    linked project — the people who can act on the database through Nebula at all.
  - _Not for SQLite_ (no accounts) _nor a connection string_ (the account is inside it):
    refused, `CONNECTION_AUTH_MODE_INVALID`.

  **Verified:** `connections/credentialRoutes.test.ts` (mode rules, rights, refusal, the
  account never returned nor stored in clear, audit, export, cascade on user and connection
  delete, the service account for unattended work, the actor not outliving its request),
  `migrations.test.ts`, `e2e/personal-accounts.e2e.ts`. **Not verified: a real login.** No
  database server on the machine: the step "the database accepts this account" is replaced in
  the server test, and the browser test stops at the refusal. Try it once on PostgreSQL and
  MySQL before relying on it. **Still to do:**
  - A pre-deployment backup and a backup started by hand run as the person; a long one
    outlives the request and keeps that account — fine, but not re-checked if the account is
    removed meanwhile.
  - Nothing tells a user that an account they gave stopped working (password changed on the
    database) before the next action fails with the database's own message.
  - Creating the database accounts themselves is the DBA's (the console's "Utilisateurs"
    panel can, as whoever is connected); no "invite this user and create their account" flow.
  - ~~`/api/v1`: no route to give an account by API~~ — done 2026-10-06:
    `GET` / `PUT` / `DELETE /api/v1/connections/:id/credentials`
    (`publicApi/credentialRoutes.ts`, rules shared in `connections/credentialService.ts`),
    scope `connections:manage`. A key restricted to one project is allowed only when the
    connection is attached to that project **and** its owner's right to use the connection
    comes from that project. Verified in `connections/credentialApi.test.ts` (with a key,
    pull and deploy answer `409 PERSONAL_CREDENTIALS_REQUIRED` before the account is given
    and no longer after).
  - External authentication (IAM tokens, Kerberos, client certificates) — passwords only.
  - The security review of the Phase 27 rule: this changes which account every statement runs
    as.

- [~] **Residual security gaps** — **M**:
  - **SQL Server / Oracle connection strings** and a PostgreSQL / MySQL URL carrying its own TLS
    options (`sslrootcert`, `?ssl=`) are **checked but not pinned** to the resolved address
    (rewriting would drop options). DNS rebinding is otherwise closed (`targetPinning.ts`).
  - `NEBULADB_SQLITE_DIR` is **opt-in**; making it the default is a breaking change to schedule.
  - A general private-IP-range block — deliberately not default (a self-hosted DB is often on
    `localhost` / LAN).
  - Audit what `sampleData` / risk-inspection queries can leak across a permission boundary
    (also relevant to Phase 32 destructive-change sampling).
  - An independent security review by someone who hasn't been staring at this code — owed for
    Phase F (users & permissions), the Ref-direction change below, and every Phase 32 item.
  - MySQL: no way to roll back _through_ a mid-batch failure (DDL auto-commits).
  - Orphan rows from before the project-delete fix: one-off cleanup `DELETE … WHERE project_id
NOT IN (SELECT id FROM projects)` is worth running on existing instances (migration 18
    already drops connections whose project is gone).
  - ~~Nothing stops an admin from locking or dropping the connection's **own** account~~ —
    closed 2026-10-06: drop, lock and password change of the account the connection signs in
    with (stored, in its connection string, or the caller's own in personal mode) are refused
    on the preview already, `DB_ADMIN_CONNECTION_ACCOUNT_PROTECTED`
    (`dbAdmin/connectionAccount.ts`, `dbAccess/routes.test.ts`). Revoking its privileges or
    roles is not intercepted.
  - Column-level grants are readable but not grantable from the UI (Phase F); declaring intended
    grants in the project so drift covers permissions is still open.
- [x] **Phase E — CI/CD automation** — the CLI (`packages/cli`) and the GitHub Action (`actions/nebuladb`) are built on the `/api/v1` primitives; a real CI run of them is still owed (see the CI example item under "Verify"). Overlaps Phase 38 idea 25.
- [ ] **Database console follow-ups** — from the console plan's phase 4: data **import**,
      schema comparison **between two connections** (now covered by Phase 32 environment
      comparison), SSH tunnel and custom CA for TLS (done: a connection's Sécurité tab), CodeMirror SQL editor with
      completion (Phase 31), MongoDB. SQLite queries run synchronously and cannot be timed out.
      Backup / restore moved to Phase 32.

### Phase 28 — Canvas feedback

- **Still owed (Phase 27 rule):** the Ref-direction fix changed deployment SQL — have someone else
  review it before the next real deployment, even though every path is tested. The remaining open
  items of this phase (waypoints, wrong-way relation, copy / paste) moved to Phase 29.

---

## Done (condensed)

- **Phase 6** — DBML-panel resync data-loss bug (`documentSync` + three-way merge
  `preserveConcurrentAdditions`, `concurrentEdits.ts`); committed multi-user regression test
  (`importExport.concurrency.test.ts`).
- **Phase 10** — Docker build verified on a real daemon (`node:22-bookworm-slim`), graceful
  `SIGTERM`.
- **Phase 11 / 16** — Unit, integration (REST + WS) and browser E2E tests (`apps/web/e2e/`,
  shared `harness.ts`); route-level `routes.test.ts` for every module; user docs, contributing,
  `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`; lint and CI; `@dbml/core` 10.1.0, Vite 8; `npm audit` clean.
- **Phase 13 / 19** — Rate limiting, scrypt cost, session cleanup, CSRF origin check, lockout,
  audit log, TOTP 2FA, account disable / delete, **self-service password reset** (SHA-256 token
  storage, 1 h TTL, single use, cooldown, identical answer for unknown addresses).
- **Phase 20** — Configurable session length; **transactional e-mail** (`infrastructure/
mailer.ts`, `NEBULADB_SMTP_*`, `NEBULADB_PUBLIC_URL`; _not verified_ through a real
  third-party relay — one manual send worth doing); invitation delivery by e-mail.
- **Phase 21** — **Public API** `/api/v1` + **OpenAPI** (`GET /api/v1/openapi.json`, drift caught
  by `openapi.test.ts`); **webhooks** (`modules/webhooks/`, `docs/webhooks.md`, signed, retry
  queue, SSRF-safe at connect time); **project templates** (4 starters — removed since);
  **cross-project diff** (`CompareProjectsModal.svelte`); **global multi-project search**
  (`GET /api/search`).
- **Phase 22** — Light theme, `<svelte:boundary>`, loading placeholders.
- **Phase 23** — Code-splitting, Prettier gate, circular-dependency lint, complexity lint,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` table; component catalogue (`/#components`); `realtime/room.ts` split; lint
  cleanup; DBML default expressions keep their backticks on round trip (`Field.defaultKind`).
- **Phase 24** — `/api/health`, scheduled backups of the app database with retention, Docker
  Compose, logging with request ids, `GET /api/metrics`, error tracking (`error_log`).
- **Phase 25** — GDPR export / deletion / retention, self-hosted Google Fonts, reverse-proxy
  guidance.
- **Phase 27** — DNS-rebinding closed for host/port configs and PG/MySQL URLs; `NEBULADB_SQLITE_
DIR`; project-scoped connection access fixed; per-target rate limiting (`connectionBudget.ts`);
  project-delete cascade of connections; instance-level connections + Oracle (migration 18);
  **database console** — explorer, SQL console, drops behind a SQL preview, session monitor with
  kill, read-only flag, CSV export, audit (migration 19); **Phase F users & permissions** for
  PostgreSQL, MySQL / MariaDB, SQL Server, Oracle (live tests in `dbAdmin/drivers/live.test.ts`);
  encryption key rotation (`rotate-secret`).
- **Phase 28** — **Ref direction** (`from` = FK column, `to` = referenced; `refOrientation.ts`,
  serializer, display, Mermaid, `Room` repair of inverted refs); settings popovers; table-block
  reorder survives resync (`TABLE_ORDER_KEY`); `Ctrl+F` in the DBML editor; cardinality glyphs and
  relation reversal; canvas responsiveness after a DBML edit.
- **Also shipped** — New project from database, table duplication (`Ctrl/Cmd+D`), Check
  differences between a project and a connected database.

---

## Open decisions (revisit as needed)

- **Auth model** — resolved: e-mail / password with sessions, per-project / team permissions,
  invitations, admin console. OpenID Connect SSO has since been added (`modules/auth/oidc.ts`).
- **Canvas library** — resolved 2026-09-22: React Flow → **Svelte Flow** with the full Svelte 5
  rewrite (−58 % blocking time, −36 % mount time, −7 % critical-path bundle).
- **History storage** — Yjs update log + periodic snapshots, now in PostgreSQL.
- **SQLite as a SQL import / export dialect** — superseded: SQLite DDL import and export both ship as built-in plugins (`coreImport.ts`, `coreExport.ts`).
- **Plugin trust model** — sandboxed Worker + per-browser install, no server-side plugin store.
- **Desktop-only or responsive?** — undecided (Phase 22).
- **Is "local-first" the architecture or the marketing?** — the marketing; all state is server-
  side. Real offline persistence would be a new architecture.
- **Is there a hosted product?** — the landing page marks "Cloud géré" as not yet available; if it
  ships it pulls billing, tenancy and an SLA into scope.
- **i18n** — now French **and English** (`apps/web/src/locales/{fr,en}.json`; the console work
  added both); keep both complete for every new string. _(Earlier text said "all-French, no i18n
  library" — superseded.)_
- **New (2026-10-02):** environments and variants are two
  orthogonal axes (variant = _for whom_, environment = _where in the life cycle_); structure goes
  through the schema by default and the admin may relax it; AI features are optional, off by
  default, and only ever see structure or normalised statements — never real data.
