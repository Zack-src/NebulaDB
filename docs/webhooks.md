# Webhooks

A project can notify other services when something happens to it. Project
administrators manage them from the project card (**Webhooks** button). A
project can have up to 10.

## Events

| Event                  | Sent when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `schema.changed`       | The schema changed, once the project has seen **30 seconds without an edit**. A burst of edits becomes one notification listing every author. Moving tables or changing colours doesn't count.                                                         |
| `deployment.completed` | A deployment or a rollback to a connected database finished — successfully or not.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `deployment.review`    | A review request for a deployment to a stage whose protection is "Revue" was made, approved, rejected, withdrawn, or closed (expired, out of date, cancelled). The deployment of an approved request is a `deployment.completed`.                      |
| `drift.detected`       | The project's watch (switched on through the API, or imposed by an instance administrator on the connection; the project card has no screen for it) found a database changed outside Nebula since the last deployment or pull — or, with the accounts watch on, its accounts or privileges changed (`kind: "accounts"`). Once per state of the database. |
| `ping`                 | Only when someone clicks **Tester** — never subscribed to.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Formats

- **JSON signé** (`json`): the full event, below. Use this for your own endpoints.
- **Slack** (`slack`): `{ "text": "…" }` — paste a Slack _incoming webhook_ URL.
- **Discord** (`discord`): `{ "content": "…" }` — paste a Discord channel webhook URL.

Slack and Discord messages are short French sentences built from the event.

## The JSON payload

```json
{
  "id": "5b0c…",
  "event": "schema.changed",
  "occurredAt": "2026-09-23T21:14:07.512Z",
  "project": { "id": "…", "name": "Shop", "url": "https://schemas.example.com/project/…" },
  "data": {
    "authors": ["Alice"],
    "changes": { "tablesAdded": 2, "tablesRemoved": 0, "tablesChanged": 1, "refsChanged": 1 },
    "tableCount": 8
  }
}
```

`project.url` is `null` unless `NEBULADB_PUBLIC_URL` is set. `data.changes` is
`null` in the rare case the server has no earlier state to compare with.

For `deployment.completed`, `data` is `{ kind: "deploy" | "rollback",
connectionName, environment, engine, success, executedStatements, error,
executedBy }` — `executedBy` is the email of the person who ran it.

For `deployment.review`, `data` is `{ action: "requested" | "approved" |
"rejected" | "withdrawn" | "expired" | "stale" | "cancelled", reviewId,
connectionName, environment, engine, requestedBy, by, reason }` — `requestedBy`
and `by` are emails (`by` is whoever did it, `null` when nobody did: an
approval that ran out); `reason` says why a request was closed as `stale`
(`schema`, `database`, `risks`, `seeds`) or `cancelled` (`protection`,
`connection`), and is `null` otherwise. The SQL under review is not sent. A
webhook created before this event existed is not subscribed to it: tick it in
the webhook's events.

For `drift.detected`, `data` is `{ kind: "external" | "partial-deployment",
connectionName, environment, added, removed, changed }` — the last three are
table names. `partial-deployment` means a deployment failed half-way since the
reference and explains the change.

When the project's **accounts watch** was turned on (instance administrators only, `PUT /api/projects/:id/monitoring/accounts`; no screen for it),
`drift.detected` is also sent with `kind: "accounts"`: the database's accounts,
roles or privileges changed and no action in Nebula's console explains it.
`data` is then `{ kind: "accounts", connectionName, environment, added: [],
removed: [], changed: [], accountChanges }`, where `accountChanges` counts the
changes by type (`{ "created": 1, "privilege-granted": 2 }`; the types are
`created`, `dropped`, `locked`, `unlocked`, `login-granted`, `login-removed`,
`superuser-granted`, `superuser-removed`, `role-granted`, `role-revoked`,
`privilege-granted`, `privilege-revoked`). Account names are deliberately left
out of the webhook: the webhook's address is chosen by a project administrator,
the names are for the instance administrators, in the app. A receiver that
only expects tables should check `kind`.

`id` is the same for every retry of one delivery: use it to ignore duplicates.

## Verifying the signature

Every request carries:

- `X-NebulaDB-Event` — the event name
- `X-NebulaDB-Delivery` — the delivery id (same as `id` in the body)
- `X-NebulaDB-Signature` — `t=<unix seconds>,v1=<hex HMAC-SHA256>`

The HMAC is computed over `<t>.<raw request body>` with the webhook's signing
secret (`whsec_…`, shown **once**, when the webhook is created). Check it
against the raw body, before parsing, and reject old timestamps to stop replays:

```js
import crypto from "node:crypto";

function isFromNebulaDB(rawBody, signatureHeader, secret, toleranceSeconds = 300) {
  const match = /^t=(\d+),v1=([0-9a-f]{64})$/.exec(signatureHeader ?? "");
  if (!match) return false;
  const [, t, v1] = match;
  if (Math.abs(Date.now() / 1000 - Number(t)) > toleranceSeconds) return false;
  const expected = crypto.createHmac("sha256", secret).update(`${t}.${rawBody}`).digest("hex");
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(v1), Buffer.from(expected));
}
```

Lost the secret, or it leaked? **Régénérer le secret** on the webhook (or
`POST …/webhooks/:hookId/rotate-secret`) gives it a new one — shown once, like
the first — and keeps its address, events and delivery log. The old secret
stops signing at once, including for a delivery still waiting to be retried:
put the new one in the receiving service straight away.

## Delivery and retries

- A delivery succeeds on any `2xx` answer within 10 seconds. Redirects are
  **not** followed — a `3xx` is a failure.
- A failure is retried after 1 min, 5 min, 30 min, 2 h and 6 h, then abandoned.
  Retries survive a server restart.
- After **20 abandoned deliveries in a row**, the webhook switches itself off;
  the reason is shown in the list. Ticking **Actif** again resets the count.
- **Historique** lists the last 20 deliveries. The delivery log is kept 30 days.
  The response body of the receiving service is never read or stored.

## Security

- Only project administrators can see or change a project's webhooks.
- The signing secret is stored encrypted with `NEBULADB_SECRET`, which must
  be set (same requirement as database connections). Changing that key makes
  existing secrets unreadable: those webhooks' deliveries then fail with an
  explicit error until they are recreated.
- URLs must be `http(s)` and can't carry credentials. The cloud metadata
  endpoint is refused — checked against the address actually connected to,
  so a hostname that changes its DNS answer can't get around it. Loopback,
  private (RFC 1918, ULA), CGNAT, link-local, multicast and reserved addresses
  are **refused by default**, because any account can register a webhook. For a
  receiver on your LAN (an internal chat or CI server), an instance administrator
  lists it in `NEBULADB_WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (host names, `*.example.com`,
  IPs or CIDR ranges; when set, webhooks may only target listed hosts), or sets
  `NEBULADB_WEBHOOK_BLOCK_PRIVATE=0` to allow private addresses again.
- Payloads carry the project name, change counts and, for deployments and
  their reviews, the emails of those involved. Nothing of the schema itself
  is sent.
