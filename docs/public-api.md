# Public API (`/api/v1`)

A stable, versioned REST surface for scripts, CI pipelines and other tools —
separate from the internal `/api/*` routes the web app itself uses (those
stay cookie-session-only and are not a stable contract).

## Authentication

Any user can create their own keys in **Settings → API keys** — for every
project they can see, or restricted to a single one — or via the
session-authed management endpoints below. Every `/api/v1` request needs it:

```
Authorization: Bearer ndb_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

The key authenticates **as the user who created it** — it can do anything
that user's own project permissions allow, narrowed by whatever scopes and
project restriction you gave it at creation time. Only a SHA-256 hash of the
key is ever stored; the full value is shown once, at creation, and cannot be
retrieved again — treat a lost key as gone and issue a new one.

### Scopes

| Scope                 | Grants                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `projects:read`       | List/read projects, export DBML/SQL/SVG/PNG, schema history, IAM, deployment history                                                                                                                                      |
| `projects:write`      | Create/rename/archive/delete a project, import/edit its schema, IAM grant/revoke                                                                                                                                          |
| `deployments:trigger` | Run a deployment or rollback against a connected database                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `connections:manage`  | Create/update/delete/test a database connection, pull a live schema onto the canvas; give one's own account on a database that asks for it; take, download and delete a database's backups (instance administrators only) |
| `teams:manage`        | Create/rename/delete a team, add/remove its members — instance-wide, global-admin-only                                                                                                                                    |

A key with no matching scope gets `403 API_SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT`, not a silent
downgrade. A key created with a specific `projectId` only works against that
one project (`403 API_KEY_PROJECT_RESTRICTED` against any other) — omit it
for a key that should follow whatever projects its owner can see. Team and
backup routes are instance-wide, not project-scoped — a project-restricted
key is refused outright (`403 API_KEY_PROJECT_RESTRICTED`) rather than let
through unscoped.

### Key management (session-only)

These are reachable from a browser session but **not** from another API
key — a key that could mint or revoke keys would let one leaked key
escalate into every key its owner has.

| -------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/api/keys`     | —                                             |
| `POST`   | `/api/keys`     | `{ name, scopes: ApiKeyScope[], projectId? }` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/keys/:id` | —                                             |

## Endpoints

All project routes take a permission check identical to the web app's own
(`view` for reads, `edit` for the import, project `deploy` for
deploy/rollback and what goes with them, project `administrator` for
IAM/connections/webhooks/delete) — a scope only ever narrows what the key can
do on top of that, it never grants more than the underlying user already has.
"(+ admin)" below means the caller also needs project `administrator`, and
"(+ deploy)" project `deploy` or above — the same elevated permission the
equivalent internal route requires; a scope alone is never enough for these.

The four project levels, each including the ones before it: `view`, `edit`,
`deploy` (plan, deploy, roll back, deployment history, pipeline, compare,
"check now") and `administrator` (access, connections and pull, locks,
webhooks, lint rules, the watch's settings). The level is the owner's on the
project; scopes are a separate, narrower thing.

On the production stage `confirmName` (the connection's name) is required and the database is backed up first unless `backupBefore: false`; a backup that does not complete refuses the deployment (`502 BACKUP_FAILED`). The answer carries `backupId`.

No connection route but `GET` (list) is open to `edit` — they open a
connection to a host/file the caller supplies, or execute generated SQL
against it, a materially larger blast radius than a plain schema edit. Using
the databases the project already has (deploy, rollback, history, pipeline,
compare, `monitoring/check`) takes project `deploy`; choosing them (create,
update, detach, test) and `pull`, which replaces the project's schema with
the database's, take project `administrator`.

#### Review before a protected stage

A stage whose protection is `review` (Admin → Environnements, "Revue") takes
a deployment only with the approval of another person. `deploy` answers
`409 DEPLOYMENT_REVIEW_REQUIRED` there; the way through is:

1. someone who may deploy **requests a review**
   (`POST …/connections/:connId/reviews`). The server prepares the deployment
   and freezes it: the schema's hash, the SQL, the answers to the risks, the
   seeds option, the connection, an optional message. One open request per
   project and connection.
2. **another person** who may deploy on the project — never the author; an
   instance administrator counts — **approves** or **rejects**, with an
   optional comment. A key is its owner: a second key of the same person
   does not make a second person. Someone alone on a project therefore
   cannot deploy to such a stage; an instance administrator approves, or
   changes the stage's protection.
3. the author or the approver **deploys the approved request**
   (`POST …/reviews/:reviewId/deploy`). The server plans again and compares:
   if the SQL, the risks and their answers, or the seeds are no longer what
   was approved, it answers `409 DEPLOYMENT_REVIEW_STALE` with `reason`
   (`schema`, `database`, `risks`, `seeds`), closes the request and runs
   nothing. An approval is good for 7 days (`409 DEPLOYMENT_REVIEW_EXPIRED`
   after that).

The author can withdraw a request at any time before it is deployed. A request
is cancelled when its stage stops asking for a review, or when its connection
is detached or moved to another stage. Production confirmation
(`confirmName`), the backup before a production deployment, lint blocking and
the stage order all apply to the deployment of an approved request as to any
other; the stage order is not checked when the request is made. A rollback
does not go through the review flow (it undoes a deployment already
recorded, often in a hurry): on a stage that asks for a review it answers
`409 ROLLBACK_REVIEW_REQUIRED`, unless a project `administrator` sends
`skipReview: true` with a `reason` (`400 ROLLBACK_REVIEW_REASON_REQUIRED`
without one, `403 FORBIDDEN` for anyone else) — the reason goes to the audit
log (`connection.rollback.review_skipped`) and to the rollback's history
entry. Every step is
in the audit log, the deployment history names who asked and who approved
(`history[].review`), and the project's webhooks can receive
`deployment.review`.

Connections are instance-level objects: one can be attached to several
projects. These routes only ever see the connections attached to `:id` — a
`:connId` that belongs to another project answers `404` — and history is the
project's own deployments through that connection. A connection created by an
instance administrator (admin console) can be used from here but not edited;
one marked read-only refuses `deploy` and `rollback` with
`403 CONNECTION_READ_ONLY`. Creating, editing and administering instance-level
connections (explorer, SQL console, database users) is done in the web admin
console and is not part of `/api/v1` — their backups excepted, below.

A connection can ask each user for **their own database account** instead of
sharing one (`authMode: "personal"`, set in the admin console). A key acts as
its owner: on such a connection `pull`, `deploy`, `rollback` and `compare`
run as the owner's account, and answer `409 PERSONAL_CREDENTIALS_REQUIRED`
until the owner has given one — in the app, or with
`PUT /api/v1/connections/:id/credentials`. `monitoring/check` is the
exception: like the watch itself it reads with the connection's service
account, whoever asks. The three `credentials` routes take the connection's
id alone and are open to those who use it: instance administrators and
those who may deploy (`deploy` or `administrator`) on a project it is
attached to (anyone else gets `404 CONNECTION_NOT_FOUND`). A key restricted
to one project works only on a connection attached to that project, and only
if its owner may deploy on that project (`403 API_KEY_PROJECT_RESTRICTED`

| Method   | Path                              | Scope                | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/connections/:id/backups` | `connections:manage` | A connected database's backups, newest first: `{ backups, limits, usedBytes, schedule }`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `POST`   | `/api/v1/connections/:id/backups` | `connections:manage` | `{ tables?, note? }` — starts a backup of the whole database, or of the tables named, and answers `202 { backup }` at once. One per database at a time (`409 BACKUP_ALREADY_RUNNING`)                                                                                                                                                        |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/backups/:id`             | `connections:manage` | One backup (`{ backup }`): poll it until `status` leaves `running` for `done`, `failed` (see `error`) or `cancelled`; `tables.length` of `tablesTotal` is how far it is                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `POST`   | `/api/v1/backups/:id/cancel`      | `connections:manage` | Cancels a running backup; `409 BACKUP_NOT_READY` when it is not running                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/backups/:id`             | `connections:manage` | Deletes the backup and its file; `409 BACKUP_NOT_READY` while it runs — cancel it first                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/backups/:id/download`    | `connections:manage` | The decrypted file, `application/gzip`: one JSON document per line (a header, then per table a `{ table, columns }` line, its rows as arrays, an `{ end, rows }` line). `409 BACKUP_NOT_READY` unless `done`. Restoring is deliberately not part of `/api/v1`: it empties tables, and is done in the app, where the target's name is retyped |

`:id` of a connection is the one `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/connections`
lists. A backup is every row of the database in one file, so these need an
instance administrator's key — a project administrator's is refused
(`403 ADMIN_REQUIRED`) — and, like the team routes, refuse a key restricted
to one project. The schedule and the pin are set in the app.

### Teams (instance-wide, global-admin-only)

| Method   | Path                                | Scope          | Notes                                         |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/teams`                     | `teams:manage` | Every team, with member count                 |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/teams/:id`                 | `teams:manage` | Team detail with member list                  |
| `POST`   | `/api/v1/teams`                     | `teams:manage` | `{ name }` — create a team                    |
| `PATCH`  | `/api/v1/teams/:id`                 | `teams:manage` | `{ name }` — rename                           |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/teams/:id`                 | `teams:manage` | Also drops every project grant this team held |
| `POST`   | `/api/v1/teams/:id/members`         | `teams:manage` | `{ userId }` — add a member                   |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/teams/:id/members/:userId` | `teams:manage` | Remove a member                               |

## OpenAPI

`GET /api/v1/openapi.json` returns an OpenAPI 3.1 description of every route
above — public, no key needed — for Postman, Swagger UI, Insomnia or a client
generator (`npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i
https://your-instance/api/v1/openapi.json -g typescript-fetch -o client/`).
Each operation carries its required scope as `x-nebuladb-scope`, and every
error response documents the stable `code` values. `servers` is filled in
when `NEBULADB_PUBLIC_URL` is set.

The tables on this page, the OpenAPI document and the routes actually
registered are checked against each other by
`apps/server/src/modules/publicApi/openapi.test.ts` — a route added to one and
not the others fails the build.

## Example

```bash
KEY="ndb_..."
PROJECT="proj_..."

# Pull the current schema as DBML
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  "https://your-instance/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT/export/dbml"

# Push an edit
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source": "Table users {\n  id int [pk]\n}"}' \
  "https://your-instance/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT/import"

# Trigger a deployment
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}' \
  "https://your-instance/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT/connections/$CONN_ID/deploy"
```

### In a CI job

A job that deploys the schema only when it is safe to: it stops if the
linter reports errors, stops if a database of the project was changed outside
the schema, then deploys. `curl` (7.76 or later, for `--fail-with-body`) and
`jq` are all it needs.

The key belongs to someone with project `deploy` (or `administrator`) and carries `projects:read`
(lint, check) and `deployments:trigger` (deploy); restrict it to the project.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ci/nebula-deploy.sh
set -euo pipefail

: "${NEBULA_URL:?}" "${NEBULA_KEY:?}" "${PROJECT:?}" "${CONN_ID:?}"
CONN_NAME="${CONN_NAME:-}"     # the connection's name: needed on the production stage
RESOLUTIONS="${RESOLUTIONS:-}" # answers to the risks of this deployment (JSON), see below
[ -n "$RESOLUTIONS" ] || RESOLUTIONS='{}'
API="$NEBULA_URL/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT"

# Prints the answer; on an error status, prints it ({ error, code, ... }) to stderr and fails.
call() {
  local body
  if ! body=$(curl --silent --show-error --fail-with-body \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEBULA_KEY" "$@"); then
    echo "$body" >&2
    return 1
  fi
  printf '%s' "$body"
}

# 1. The schema against the project's own lint rules.
lint=$(call "$API/lint")
if [ "$(jq '.summary.error' <<<"$lint")" -gt 0 ]; then
  jq -r '.findings[] | select(.severity == "error") | "lint: \(.tableName): \(.message)"' <<<"$lint" >&2
  exit 1
fi

# 2. The project's databases against what was last deployed to them.
check=$(call -X POST "$API/monitoring/check")
if [ "$(jq '.result.unreachable' <<<"$check")" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "a database could not be read: nothing is known about it" >&2
  exit 1
fi
# result.changes counts what this check found for the first time; a change
# already reported stays in events, open, until it is settled.
drift=$(jq '.result.changes + ([.events[] | select(.status == "open" and .kind != "unreachable")] | length)' <<<"$check")
if [ "$drift" -gt 0 ]; then
  jq -r '.events[] | select(.status == "open") | "changed outside the schema: \(.connectionName) (\(.kind))"' <<<"$check" >&2
  exit 1
fi

# 3. Deploy.
body=$(jq -n --arg name "$CONN_NAME" --argjson resolutions "$RESOLUTIONS" \
  '{ confirmName: $name, resolutions: $resolutions }')
call -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$body" \
  "$API/connections/$CONN_ID/deploy" | jq '{ success, executedStatements, backupId }'
```

The same as a GitHub Actions job, the key and the ids kept as repository
secrets and variables:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy-schema:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Lint, check and deploy the schema
        env:
          NEBULA_URL: https://your-instance
          NEBULA_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEBULA_KEY }}
          PROJECT: ${{ vars.NEBULA_PROJECT }}
          CONN_ID: ${{ vars.NEBULA_CONNECTION }}
          CONN_NAME: Production
        run: bash ci/nebula-deploy.sh
```

Or with the [NebulaDB GitHub Action](../actions/nebuladb/README.md), which runs the same checks through
the `nebuladb` CLI (`command: lint`, `drift-check`, `deploy-plan` or `deploy`) without a script to maintain.

What the deployment step meets on its way:

- **`confirmName`** is the connection's name, as `GET
/api/v1/projects/:id/connections` lists it. On the production stage the
  deployment is refused without it (`409 PRODUCTION_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`);
  elsewhere it is not looked at.
- **`resolutions`** answers the changes that lose or reject data, one entry
  per risk: `{ "column:users.legacy_code": { "strategy": "DROP_DATA_CONFIRMED" } }`,
  `{ "column:users.country": { "strategy": "BACKFILL_DEFAULT", "value": "FR" } }`
  (keys are lower-case: `table:<table>` or `column:<table>.<column>`). Away
  from production a risk left unanswered takes its default — a dropped column
  that holds data is kept in the database. On the production stage a critical
  risk needs its answer: the deployment is refused with
  `409 DESTRUCTIVE_CHANGE_UNRESOLVED` and the list of `risks` to answer, so a
  job never loses data nobody decided to lose. Set `RESOLUTIONS` for that one
  run, once someone has decided.
- On the production stage the database is **backed up first** (`backupId` in
  the answer; `502 BACKUP_FAILED` and nothing deployed when the backup does
  not complete), and a stage that is not `free` wants the stage before it to
  have this schema already (`409 PIPELINE_STAGE_SKIPPED`): run the job on that
  stage's connection first.
- When the connection asks each user for **their own database account**, the
  deployment runs as the account of the key's owner, and is refused with
  `409 PERSONAL_CREDENTIALS_REQUIRED` until the owner has given one. Once, in
  the app or with a key that carries `connections:manage`:

  ```bash
  curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username": "ci_deployer", "password": "..."}' \
    "https://your-instance/api/v1/connections/$CONN_ID/credentials"
  ```

  The check of step 2 is not concerned: like the watch, it reads with the
  connection's service account.

- The check only reads the databases it has a reference for — those the
  project has deployed to or pulled from at least once (`result.checked` says
  how many).
- A project can refuse by itself to deploy a schema with lint errors
  (`409 LINT_BLOCKS_DEPLOYMENT`); step 1 stops the job either way.

## Rate limits

`/api/v1` routes carry their own per-route limits (120 requests/minute for
reads, writes, connections, teams and IAM; 10/minute for the deploy and
rollback triggers — both execute real SQL against a real database — and for
starting or downloading a backup, every row of a database, and for giving a
personal database account, which tries it on the database), on top of the
app's global ceiling.

Independently of who calls, each **target database** (same engine, host,
port and database — or the same SQLite file) accepts at most 30 connection
operations (test, pull, plan, deploy, rollback) and 5 executed migrations or
rollbacks per minute, across the web UI and every API key. Past that the
server answers `429` with code `CONNECTION_RATE_LIMITED` and a
`retryAfterSeconds` hint; nothing is executed or recorded.

## Not yet built

- **Per-key usage quotas** beyond the shared route-level rate limit.
- **Multi-project key scoping** — a key is either unrestricted or locked to
  exactly one project, not a list.
- **Structured canvas-style edits** (set one table's position/color without
  writing DBML text) — today that's only reachable via the visual-metadata
  sidecar inside a DBML import, not a dedicated JSON field-level endpoint.
